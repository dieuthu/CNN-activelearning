1 There is a car race near our town every year .  In 1995 , there was a very big race .  There were hundreds of people there .  My wife and I were at the race .  Our friends Julie and Jack were there , too .  You can see us in the crowd .  We are standing on the left .  There were twenty cars in the race .  There were English cars , French cares , German cars .  Italian cars .  American cars and Japanese cars .  It was an exciting finish .  The winner was Billy Stewart .  He was in car number fifteen .  Five other cars were just behind him .  On the way home , my wife said to me , 'Do n't drive so quickly !  You 're not Billy Stewart !

3 Why did Harry decide to give up his little game ?  My cousin , Harry , keeps a large curiously-shaped bottle on permanent display in his study .  Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green , an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick , grayish substance .  If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle , he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud .  If you expressed doubt or surprise , he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin .  This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have .  The bottle really does contain perfumed mud .  How Harry came into the possession of this outlandish stuff makes an interesting story which he is fond of relating .  Furthermore , the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years .  Harry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist .  He would invent fanciful names on the spot .  On entering a shop , he would ask for a new perfume called 'Scented Shadow ' or for 'insoluble bath cubes ' .  If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it , he would pretend to be considerably put out .  He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date , but of course he never did .  How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me .  Harry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud .  One day , he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for 'Myrolite ' , the shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word , slowly stressing each syllable .  When the woman shook her head in bewilderment , Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite ' was a hard , amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles .  This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf .  She produced all sorts of weird concoctions , but none of them met with Harry 's requirements .  When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed , the assistant promised to order some for him .  Intoxicated by his success , Harry then asked for perfumed mud .  He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment .  However , it was his turn to be surprised , for the woman 's eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect .  For once , Harry had to admit defeat .  He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price .  He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat , clutching the precious bottle under his arm .  From then on , Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive .  The curious bottle , which now adorns the bookcase in his study , was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics .	95.0 2.0 494.0 48.0 33.0 6.0 8.6364 0.1818 44.9091 2.6559 4.3636 3.0 0.5455 0.2581 0.1774 0.0323 4.110856449 1.009857272 1.0 0.090909 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.272727 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.636364 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.090909 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.272727 21.0 1.909091 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.181818 3.0 0.272727 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 18.0 1.636364 3.0 0.272727 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 34.0 3.090909 6.0 0.545455 0.0 0.0 12.0 1.090909 30.0 2.727273 1.0 0.090909 1.0 0.090909 8.0 0.727273 10.0 0.909091 1.0 0.090909 711.0 226.0 165.0 3.0 1.0 93.0 71.0 11.0 4.309091 1.369697 20.545455 15.0 0.272727 0.090909 0.563636 0.430303 2.0 
3 What could not be reported in the official flees ?  The Scandinavian countries are much admired all over the world for their enlightened social policies .  Sweden has evolved an excellent system for protecting the individual citizen from highhanded or incompetent public officers .  The system has worked so well , that it has been adopted in other countries too .  The Swedes were the first to recognize that public official like civil servants , police officers , health inspectors or tax-collectors can make mistakes or act over-zealously in the belief that they are serving the public .  As long ago as 1809 , the Swedish Parliament introduced a scheme to safeguard the interest of the individual .  A parliamentary committee representing all political parties appoints a person who is suitably qualified to investigate private grievances against the State .  The official title of the person is 'Justiteombudsman ' , but the Swedes commonly refer to him as the 'J.O . '  or 'Ombudsman ' .  The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure .  He investigates complaints large and small that come to him from all levels of society .  As complaints must be made in writing , the Ombudsman receives an average of 1,200 letters a year .  He has eight lawyer assistants to help him and examines every single letter in detail .  There is nothing secretive about the Ombudsman 's work for his correspondence is open to public inspection .  If a citizen 's complaint is justified , the Ombudsman will act on his behalf .  The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint .  He may gently reprimand an official or even suggest to parliament that a law the altered .  The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman 's work .  A foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been ill-treated by the police , simply because he was a foreigner .  The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case .  There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner 's complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation .  It was impossible for the Ombudsman to take action , but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village , he immediately sent one of his layers to investigate the matter .  The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt roughly with foreigners on several occasions .  The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be recorded in the official files .  It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts .  The policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if any further complaints were lodged against him , he would prosecuted .  The Ombudsman 's prompt action at once put an end to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed .	105.0 5.0 507.0 59.0 40.0 6.0 9.5455 0.4545 46.0909 2.7857 5.3636 3.6364 0.5455 0.3242 0.2198 0.033 4.365298943 0.939475714 7.0 0.636364 17.0 1.545455 5.0 0.454545 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.272727 2.0 0.181818 1.0 0.090909 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.454545 20.0 1.818182 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.272727 10.0 0.909091 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.636364 4.0 0.363636 4.0 0.363636 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 20.0 1.818182 2.0 0.181818 1.0 0.090909 11.0 1.0 20.0 1.818182 3.0 0.272727 1.0 0.090909 7.0 0.636364 10.0 0.909091 2.0 0.181818 675.0 213.0 162.0 3.0 3.0 103.0 77.0 11.0 4.166667 1.314815 19.363636 14.727273 0.272727 0.272727 0.635802 0.475309 2.0 
3 What did the man expect to find under the stairs ?  After her husband had gone to work .  Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom .  She was too excited to do any housework that morning , for in the evening she would be going to a fancy-dress part with her husband .  She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume the night before , she was impatient to try it on .  Though the costume consisted only of a sheet , it was very effective .  After putting it on , Mrs. Richards went downstairs .  She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear .  Just as Mrs. Richards was entering the dinning room , there was a knock on the front door .  She knew that it must be the baker .  She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table .  Not wanting to frighten the poor man , Mrs. Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs .  She heard the front door open and heavy footsteps in the hall .  Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered .  Mrs. Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the metre .  She tried to explain the situation , saying 'It 's only me ' , but it was too late .  The man let out cry and jumped back several paces .  When Mrs. Richards walked towards him , he fled , slamming the door behind him .	107.0 4.0 500.0 68.0 34.0 1.0 8.9167 0.3333 41.6667 2.5126 5.6667 2.8333 0.0833 0.3417 0.1709 0.005 4.287521072 1.23408115 0.0 0.0 14.0 1.166667 11.0 0.916667 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.166667 2.0 0.166667 2.0 0.166667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.166667 24.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 11.0 0.916667 1.0 0.083333 2.0 0.166667 16.0 1.333333 5.0 0.416667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.083333 27.0 2.25 1.0 0.083333 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.25 15.0 1.25 7.0 0.583333 9.0 0.75 7.0 0.583333 10.0 0.833333 1.0 0.083333 717.0 228.0 165.0 2.0 2.0 90.0 54.0 12.0 4.345455 1.381818 19.0 13.75 0.166667 0.166667 0.545455 0.327273 2.0 
3 Was the writer successful in protecting his peach tree ?  Why not ?  We have been brought up to fear insects .  We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good .  We continually wage war on them , for they contaminate our food , carry diseases , or devour our crops .  They sting or bite without provocation ; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights , or beat ageist our lighted windows .  We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps , but of quite harmless one like moths .  Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears .  Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch .  No matter how much we like honey , or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess , we have a horror of being stung .  Most of our fears are unreasonable , but they are impossible to erase .  At the same time , however , insects are strangely fascinating .  We enjoy reading about them , especially when we find that , like the praying mantis , they lead perfectly horrible lives .  We enjoy staring at them , entranced as they go about their business , unaware ( we hope ) of our presence .  Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly , or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle ?  Last summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree .  The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house .  I am especially proud of it , not only because it has survived several severe winters , but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches .  During the summer , I noticed tat the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither .  Clusters of tin insects called aphids were to be found on the underside of the leaves .  They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them .  I immediately embarked on an experiment which , even though if failed to get rid of the ants , kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours .  I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape , making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids .  The tape was so stick that they did not dare to cross it .  For a long time .  I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment .  I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction ( and surprise ) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it .  I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair .  Instead , I saw that they had discovered a new route .  They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree .  I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity .  The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods !	126.0 6.0 591.0 72.0 43.0 1.0 10.5 0.5 49.25 2.7617 6.0 3.5833 0.0833 0.3364 0.2009 0.0047 4.4988096 0.84126359 2.0 0.166667 8.0 0.666667 7.0 0.583333 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.416667 9.0 0.75 4.0 0.333333 1.0 0.083333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.25 24.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.166667 6.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.083333 14.0 1.166667 3.0 0.25 1.0 0.083333 2.0 0.166667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 30.0 2.5 7.0 0.583333 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.666667 23.0 1.916667 2.0 0.166667 0.0 0.0 15.0 1.25 11.0 0.916667 3.0 0.25 751.0 249.0 188.0 3.0 2.0 123.0 99.0 12.0 3.994681 1.324468 20.75 15.666667 0.25 0.166667 0.654255 0.526596 2.0 
3 Which life forms are most likely to develop on a distant planet ?  Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our won Milky Way and in other galaxies .  This is a major achievement because , in relative terms , planets are very small and old not emit light .  Finding planets is proving hard enough , but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult .  The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life .  In our won solar system , for example , Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life .  Only the Earth provides ideal conditions , and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve .  Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star , that is its 'sun ' .  Imagine a star up t twenty times larger , brighter , brighter and hotter than our own sun .  A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life .  Alternatively , if the star were small , the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop .  But how would we find such a planet ?  At present , there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life .  The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century .  It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes .  Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets .  Even a telescope in orbit round the earth , like the very successful Hubble telescope , would not be suitable because of the dust particles iron solar system .  A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space , because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system .  Once we detected a planet , we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star , so that we would be able to 'see ' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere .  In the first instance , we would be looking for plant life , rather than 'little green men ' .  The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria .  It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth .  For most of the earth 's history they have been the only form of life on our planet .  As Earth-dwellers , we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them .  But this hope is always in the realms of science fiction .  If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet , it would completely change our view of ourselves .  As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed , 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything .  No human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it .

3 Why had the neighbours left their farm ?  The river which forms the eastern boundary of our farm has always played an important part in our lives .  Without it we could not make a living .  There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the houses , so we have to pump from the river for farm use .  We tell river all our secrets .  We know instinctively , just as beekeepers with their bees , that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it .  We have special river birthday parties in the summer .  Sometimes were go upstream to a favourite backwater , sometimes we have our party at the boathouse , which a predecessor of ours at the farm built in the meadow hard by the deepest pool for swimming and diving .  In a heat wave we choose a midnight birthday party and that is the most exciting of all .  We welcome the seasons by the riverside , crowning the youngest girl with flowers in the spring , holding a summer festival on Midsummer Eve , giving thanks for the harvest in the autumn , and throwing a holy wreath into the current in the winter .  After a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks .  This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom guest to extremes .  We are lucky in that only the lower fields , which make up a very small proportion of our farm , are effected by flooding , but other farms are less favorably sited , and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners .  One had winter we watched the river creep up the lower meadows .  All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little .  We were , however , worried about our nearest neighbors , whose farm was low lying and who were newcomers to the district .  As the floods had put the telephone out of order , we could not find out how they were managing .  From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours , and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point .  The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down .  Next came a horse , swimming bravely , but we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted .  Suddenly a raft appeared , looking rather like Noah 's ark , carrying the whole family , a few hens , the dogs , cat , and bird in a cage .  We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood , for their house , which had sound foundations , would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged .  The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadows with boathooks , in the hope of being able to grapple a corner of the raft and pull it out of the current towards our bank .  We still think it a miracle that they we able to do so .	112.0 4.0 548.0 61.0 38.0 5.0 8.0 0.2857 39.1429 2.622 4.3571 2.7143 0.3571 0.2919 0.1818 0.0239 4.427411429 0.833061436 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.071429 10.0 0.714286 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.071429 4.0 0.285714 1.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.285714 16.0 1.142857 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.285714 4.0 0.285714 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 20.0 1.428571 2.0 0.142857 3.0 0.214286 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 36.0 2.571429 7.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.714286 31.0 2.214286 1.0 0.071429 2.0 0.142857 16.0 1.142857 9.0 0.642857 0.0 0.0 765.0 244.0 184.0 2.0 1.0 120.0 97.0 14.0 4.157609 1.326087 17.428571 13.142857 0.142857 0.071429 0.652174 0.527174 2.0 
3 Did the narrator find is mother 's grave ?  I stopped to let the car cool off and to study the map .  I had expected to be near my objective by now , but everything still seemed alien to me .  I was only five when my father had taken me abroad , and that we eighteen years ago .  When my mother had died after a tragic accident , he did not quickly recover from the shock and loneliness .  Everything around him was full of her presence , continually reopening the wound .  So he decided to emigrate .  In the new country he became absorbed in making a new life for the two of us , so that he gradually ceased to grieve .  He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman 's care ; but I lacked for nothing , for he was both father and mother to me .  He always meant to go back on day , but not to stay .  His roots and mine bad become too firmly embedded in the new land .  But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother 's grave .  He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and , when he knew that he was dying , he made me promise to go on my own .  I hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps , which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey , but which I did not think I should need on the last stage .  It was not that I actually remembered anything at all .  But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone , after leaving the nearest town , so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory .  Well , I had been wrong , for I was now lost .  I looked at the map and then at the millimeter .  I had come ten miles since leaving the town , and at this point , according to my father , I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley , with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance .  I could see no valley , no farms , no cottages and no church spire -- only a lake .  I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere .  So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route , taking frequent glances at the map .  I landed up at the same corner .  The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map .  I left as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country , as you sometimes do in dreams .  And , as in a nightmare , there was nobody in sight to help me .  Fortunately for me , as I was wondering what to do next , there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback , riding in my direction .  I waited till he came near , then I asked him the way to our old village .  He said that there was now no village .  I thought he must have misunderstood me , so I repeated its name .  This time he pointed to the lake .  The village no longer existed because it had been submerged , and all the valley too .  The lake was not a natural one , but a man-made reservoir .	121.0 5.0 556.0 71.0 39.0 2.0 9.3077 0.3846 42.7692 2.5273 5.4615 3.0 0.1538 0.3227 0.1773 0.0091 4.621352944 0.827960238 10.0 0.769231 16.0 1.230769 7.0 0.538462 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.230769 3.0 0.230769 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.076923 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.230769 19.0 1.461538 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.076923 9.0 0.692308 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.076923 3.0 0.230769 10.0 0.769231 3.0 0.230769 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 36.0 2.769231 5.0 0.384615 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.384615 23.0 1.769231 6.0 0.461538 2.0 0.153846 11.0 0.846154 13.0 1.0 3.0 0.230769 818.0 271.0 179.0 6.0 1.0 123.0 97.0 13.0 4.569832 1.513966 20.846154 13.769231 0.461538 0.076923 0.687151 0.541899 2.0 
3 What did the old lady find when she got home ?  The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived .  Her shopping had tired her and her basket ad grown heavier with every step of the way home .  In the life her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest ; but when she got out at her own floor , both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open .  She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence , when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks , She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open , yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out .  Looking into the drawing room , she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk .  It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence .  Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves , but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her , so she went to fetch the porter from his basement .  By this time her legs were beginning to tremble , so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea , while he telephoned the police .  Then , her composure regained , she was ready to set off with the porter 's assistance to search for nay intruders who might still be lurking in her flat .  They went through the rooms , being careful to touch nothing , as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints .  The chaos was inconceivable .  She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding ; and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over .  At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her .  Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat .  The inspector began to look for fingerprints , while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced , thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony .  There was no trace of fingerprints , but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers .  So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars ' first job that day and they must have been disturbed .  The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights .  The old lady though the was a fussy creature , but since the porter agreed with him , she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother .	127.0 7.0 566.0 64.0 45.0 2.0 9.7692 0.5385 43.5385 2.802 4.9231 3.4615 0.1538 0.3168 0.2228 0.0099 4.30754156 1.030601214 6.0 0.461538 7.0 0.538462 7.0 0.538462 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.307692 6.0 0.461538 2.0 0.153846 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.461538 19.0 1.461538 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.230769 8.0 0.615385 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 14.0 1.076923 1.0 0.076923 1.0 0.076923 1.0 0.076923 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 32.0 2.461538 2.0 0.153846 4.0 0.307692 11.0 0.846154 34.0 2.615385 2.0 0.153846 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.384615 7.0 0.538462 2.0 0.153846 749.0 249.0 180.0 6.0 2.0 101.0 73.0 13.0 4.161111 1.383333 19.153846 13.846154 0.461538 0.153846 0.561111 0.405556 2.0 
3 What in particular does a person gain when he or she becomes a serious collector ?  People tend to amass possessions , sometimes without being aware of doing so .  Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned .  Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter .  They leave unwanted objects in drawers , cupboards and attics for years , in the belief that they may one day need just those very things .  As they grow old , people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons , lack of physical and mental energy , both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away , and sentiment .  Things owned for a long time are full associations with the past , perhaps with relatives who are dead , and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth .  Some things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste .  Among these I would list string and brown paper , kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened , to save buying these two requisites .  Collecting small items can easily become a mania .  I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money .  As she is not rich , the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote ; but she is never sufficiently strong-minded to be able to stop the practice .  It is a harmless bait , but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it , loose bits of paper fall out in every direction .  Collecting as a serous hobby is quite different and has many advantages .  It provides relaxation for leisure hours , as just looking at one 's treasures is always a joy .  One does not have to go outside for amusement , since the collection is housed at home .  Whatever it consists of , stamps , records , first editions of books china , glass , antique furniture , pictures , model cars , stuffed birds , toy animals , there is always something to do in connection with it , from finding the right place for the latest addition , to verifying facts in reference books .  This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject , but also in general matters which have some bearing on it .  There are also other benefits .  One wants to meet like-minded collectors , to get advice , to compare notes , to exchange articles , to show off the latest find .  So one 's circle of friends grows .  Soon the hobby leads to travel , perhaps to a meeting in another town , possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen , for collectors are not confined to any one country .  Over the years , one may well become a authority on one 's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then , if successful , to larger audiences .  In this way self-confidence grows , first from mastering a subject , then from being able to take about it .  Collecting , by occupying spare time so constructively , makes a person contented , with no time for boredom .	129.0 7.0 583.0 72.0 44.0 7.0 9.2143 0.5 41.6429 2.7371 5.1429 3.1429 0.5 0.338 0.2066 0.0329 4.576543156 0.944048387 4.0 0.285714 5.0 0.357143 8.0 0.571429 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.142857 6.0 0.428571 2.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.071429 1.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.5 23.0 1.642857 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.142857 3.0 0.214286 1.0 0.071429 1.0 0.071429 19.0 1.357143 3.0 0.214286 2.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 34.0 2.428571 7.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.214286 18.0 1.285714 2.0 0.142857 8.0 0.571429 20.0 1.428571 11.0 0.785714 0.0 0.0 805.0 268.0 190.0 4.0 3.0 122.0 92.0 14.0 4.236842 1.410526 19.142857 13.571429 0.285714 0.214286 0.642105 0.484211 2.0 
3 How did Mr. Taylor try to stop the thieves ?  The expensive shops in a famous near Piccadilly were just `` opening .  At this time of the morning , the arcade was almost empty .  Mr. Taylor , the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new display .  Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished .  Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet .  After gazing at the display for several minutes , Mr. Taylor went back into his shop .  The silence was suddenly broken when a large car , with its headlights on and its home blaring , roared down the arcade .  It came to a stop outside the jeweller 's .  One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stocking over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars .  While this was going on , Mr. Taylor was upstairs .  He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window .  Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade .  One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue , but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain .  The raid was all over in three minutes , for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed .  Just as it was leaving , Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases , but it was impossible to stop the thieves .  They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds .	132.0 9.0 599.0 52.0 62.0 7.0 11.0 0.75 49.9167 2.8937 4.3333 5.1667 0.5833 0.2512 0.2995 0.0338 4.425279291 0.978602098 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.25 3.0 0.25 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.25 10.0 0.833333 6.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.666667 18.0 1.5 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.25 13.0 1.083333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 21.0 1.75 4.0 0.333333 1.0 0.083333 1.0 0.083333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 31.0 2.583333 8.0 0.666667 0.0 0.0 14.0 1.166667 16.0 1.333333 2.0 0.166667 1.0 0.083333 15.0 1.25 8.0 0.666667 1.0 0.083333 776.0 254.0 190.0 4.0 1.0 114.0 86.0 12.0 4.084211 1.336842 21.166667 15.833333 0.333333 0.083333 0.6 0.452632 2.0 
3 Why did the young girl miss the train ?  Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society .  Without it , nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion ; everything would be in state of chaos .  Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it .  In ordinary living , there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality .  The intellectual , who is working on some abstruse problem , has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand .  He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party .  But people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine .  It is hard for energetic , quick-minded people to waste time , so they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment .  If no accidents occur on the way , like punctured tires , diversions of traffic , sudden descent of fog , they will be on time .  They are often more industrious , useful citizens than those who are never late .  The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual .  The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance .  Some friends of my family had this irritating habit .  The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests .  Then they arrived just when we wanted them .  If you are citing a train , it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minted too late .  Although being early may mean wasting a little time , this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one ; and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it .  An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you .  Such an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was traveling alone .  She entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due , since her parents had impressed upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her .  She gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket .  To her horror he said that she was two hours too soon .  She felt inhere handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down al the details of the journey and gave it to the porter .  He agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop , but only to take on mail , not passengers .  The girl asked to see a timetable , feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake .  The porter went to fetch one and arrive back with the station master , who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o ' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station ; this little 'o ' indicated that the train only stopped for mail .  Just as that moment the train came into the station .  The girl , tears streaming down her face , begged to be allowed to slip into the guard 's van .  But the station master was adamant : rules could not be broken and she had to watch that train disappear towards her destination while she was left behind .	61.0 0.0 320.0 40.0 18.0 5.0 7.625 0.0 40.0 2.56 5.0 2.25 0.625 0.32 0.144 0.04 4.033560537 1.063174148 8.0 1.0 13.0 1.625 6.0 0.75 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.25 3.0 0.375 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.25 9.0 1.125 1.0 0.125 1.0 0.125 2.0 0.25 1.0 0.125 5.0 0.625 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 19.0 2.375 7.0 0.875 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.875 12.0 1.5 1.0 0.125 1.0 0.125 5.0 0.625 4.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 460.0 153.0 111.0 3.0 3.0 65.0 44.0 8.0 4.144144 1.378378 19.125 13.875 0.375 0.375 0.585586 0.396396 2.0 
3 Why did Jane cook John 's wallet ?  Has it ever happened to you ?  Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket ?  When you rescued your trousers , did note in your back pocket ?  When you rescued your trousers , did you find the note was whiter than white ?  People who live in Britain need n't despair when they made mistakes like this ( and a lot of people do ) !  Fortunately for them , the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog .  Dogs , it seems , love to chew up money !  A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé , John , runs a successful furniture business .  John had very good day and put his wallet containing $ 3,000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping .  Then he and Jane went horse-riding .  When they got home , Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it , cooked her fiancé 's wallet as well .  Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash !  John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle : the Mutilate Ladies !  They examined the remain and John got all his money back .  'So long as there 's something to identify , we will give people their money back , ' said a spokeswoman for the Bank .  'Last year , we paid $ 1.5m on 21,000 claims .  Damaged bank notes .  The Queen 's head appears on English bank notes , and 'lady ' refers to this .	114.0 6.0 593.0 82.0 31.0 5.0 9.5 0.5 49.4167 2.7327 6.8333 2.5833 0.4167 0.3779 0.1429 0.023 4.2983665 1.147360337 1.0 0.083333 20.0 1.666667 16.0 1.333333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.416667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.083333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.166667 36.0 3.0 3.0 0.25 1.0 0.083333 8.0 0.666667 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.083333 16.0 1.333333 1.0 0.083333 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.166667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 24.0 2.0 4.0 0.333333 1.0 0.083333 3.0 0.25 25.0 2.083333 7.0 0.583333 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.583333 14.0 1.166667 0.0 0.0 851.0 278.0 193.0 7.0 1.0 103.0 71.0 12.0 4.409326 1.440415 23.166667 16.083333 0.583333 0.083333 0.533679 0.367876 2.0 
3 What are the St. Bernard dogs used for ?  The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy .  At 2,473 metres , it is the highest mountain pass in Europe .  The famous monastery of St. Bernard , witch was founded in eleventh century , lies about a mile away .  For hundreds of years , St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass .  These friendly dogs , which were first brought from Asia , were used as watchdogs even in Roman times .  Now that a tunnel ahs been built through the mountains , the Pass is less dangerous , but each year , the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty .  Despite the new tunnel , there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot .  During the summer months , the monastery is very busy , for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars .  As there are so many people about , the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure .  In winter , however , life at the monastery is quite different .  The temperature drops to -- 30 o and very few people attempt to cross the Pass .  The monks prefer winter to summer of they have more privacy .  The dogs have greater freedom , too , for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure .  The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter .  These young people , who love the peace of mountains , always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard 's monastery .	112.0 3.0 585.0 63.0 41.0 3.0 8.0 0.2143 41.7857 2.6712 4.5 2.9286 0.2143 0.2877 0.1872 0.0137 4.359513196 1.041269474 1.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.571429 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.071429 3.0 0.214286 1.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.214286 27.0 1.928571 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.214286 6.0 0.428571 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.071429 22.0 1.571429 5.0 0.357143 3.0 0.214286 2.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 35.0 2.5 8.0 0.571429 0.0 0.0 13.0 0.928571 27.0 1.928571 1.0 0.071429 1.0 0.071429 16.0 1.142857 6.0 0.428571 0.0 0.0 816.0 254.0 193.0 1.0 0.0 113.0 83.0 14.0 4.227979 1.316062 18.142857 13.785714 0.071429 0.0 0.585492 0.430052 2.0 
3 How did Haywood make in times of peace ?  There was a tine when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago that to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for 'protection . '  If the money was not paid promptly , the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop .  Obtaining 'protection money ' is not a modern crime .  As long ago as the fourteenth century , an Englishman , Sir John Hawkwood , made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters .  Six hundred years ago , Sir Johan Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near Florence .  He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto .  Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other , Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the high price he demanded .  In times of peace , when business was bad , Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and , after burning down a few farms , would offer to go away protection money was paid to them .  Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way .  In spite of this , the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero .  When he died at the age of eighty , the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a pictured with as dedicated to the memory of 'the most valiant soldier and most notable leader , Signor Giovanni Haukodue .

3 How do cats try to protect themselves when falling from great heights ?  Cats never fail to fascinate human beings .  They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans , but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well .  They never become submissive like dogs and horses .  As a result , humans have learned to respect feline independence .  Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives .  One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives .  Apparently , there is a good deal of truth in this idea .  A cat 's ability to survive falls is based on fact .  Recently the New York Animal Medical Center made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months .  All these cats had one experience in common : they had fallen off high buildings , yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries .  Of course , New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study , because there is no shortage of tall buildings .  There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from !  One cat , Sabrina , fell 32 storeys , yet only suffered from a broken tooth .  'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers . '  a doctor said .  It seems that the further cats fall , the less they are likely to injure themselves .  In a long drop , they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more .  At high speeds , falling cats have time to relax .  They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels .  This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground .	121.0 3.0 552.0 65.0 43.0 1.0 8.0667 0.2 36.8 2.4753 4.3333 2.8667 0.0667 0.2915 0.1928 0.0045 4.319441673 1.216316868 4.0 0.266667 23.0 1.533333 3.0 0.2 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.133333 5.0 0.333333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.266667 15.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.2 7.0 0.466667 1.0 0.066667 2.0 0.133333 17.0 1.133333 3.0 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 29.0 1.933333 5.0 0.333333 0.0 0.0 12.0 0.8 24.0 1.6 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.2 10.0 0.666667 16.0 1.066667 0.0 0.0 848.0 272.0 183.0 3.0 1.0 100.0 62.0 15.0 4.63388 1.486339 18.133333 12.2 0.2 0.066667 0.546448 0.338798 2.0 
3 Did George get anything for his fifty pence ?  What ?  Children always appreciate small gifts of money .  Mum or dad , of course , provide a regular supply of pocket money , but uncles and ants are always a source of extra income .  With some children , small sums go a long way .  If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets , they rattle for months inside money boxes .  Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box .  For most of them , fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate .  My nephew , George , has a money box but it is always empty .  Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there .  I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it .  Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble .  On his way to the sweet shop , he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain .  George took off his jacket , rolled up his sleeves and pushed is right arm through the drain cover .  He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere , and what is more , he could no get his arm out .  A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter , but George was firmly stuck .  The fire brigade was called and two fire fighter freed George using a special type of grease .  George was not too upset by his experience because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with large box of chocolates .	150.0 10.0 566.0 57.0 59.0 2.0 10.7143 0.7143 40.4286 2.7343 4.0714 4.2143 0.1429 0.2754 0.285 0.0097 4.356716614 1.027983402 4.0 0.285714 2.0 0.142857 23.0 1.642857 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.714286 14.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 18.0 1.285714 20.0 1.428571 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.071429 7.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.357143 7.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 21.0 1.5 4.0 0.285714 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.571429 23.0 1.642857 3.0 0.214286 2.0 0.142857 4.0 0.285714 7.0 0.5 1.0 0.071429 782.0 247.0 183.0 1.0 1.0 105.0 77.0 14.0 4.273224 1.349727 17.642857 13.071429 0.071429 0.071429 0.57377 0.420765 2.0 
3 Was Dimitri right to apologize to his neighbour ?  Why not ?  Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece .  One of Mary 's prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband had given her .  She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening .  One evening , however , the lamb was missing .  The rope had been cut , so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen .  When Dimitri came in from the fields , his wife told him what had happened .  Dimitri at once set out to find the thief .  He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village .  After telling several of his friends about the theft , Dimitri found out that his neighbour , Aleko , had suddenly acquired a new lamb .  Dimitri immediately went to Aleko 's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb .  He told him he had better return it or he would call the police .  Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard .  It was true that he had just bought a lamb , he explained , but his lamb was black .  Ashamed of having acted so rashly , Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him .  While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko 's house until the rain stopped .  When he went outside half an hour later , he was astonished to find the little black lamb was almost white .  Its wool , which had been dyed black , had been washed clean by the rain !	117.0 5.0 519.0 59.0 47.0 4.0 9.0 0.3846 39.9231 2.608 4.5385 3.6154 0.3077 0.2965 0.2362 0.0201 4.448304976 0.988087229 6.0 0.461538 7.0 0.538462 5.0 0.384615 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.230769 5.0 0.384615 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 11.0 0.846154 15.0 1.153846 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.153846 7.0 0.538462 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.076923 2.0 0.153846 7.0 0.538462 8.0 0.615385 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 26.0 2.0 4.0 0.307692 2.0 0.153846 9.0 0.692308 19.0 1.461538 1.0 0.076923 6.0 0.461538 13.0 1.0 15.0 1.153846 1.0 0.076923 745.0 248.0 174.0 7.0 5.0 113.0 85.0 13.0 4.281609 1.425287 19.076923 13.384615 0.538462 0.384615 0.649425 0.488506 2.0 
3 How is the bridge supported ?  Verrazano , an Italian about whom little is known , sailed into New York Harbour in 1524 and named it Angouleme .  He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river . '  Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer , his name will probably remain immortal , for on November 21st , 1964 , the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him .  The Verrazano Bridge , which was designed by Othmar Ammann , joins Brooklyn to Staten Island .  It has a span of 4,260 feet .  The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer .  Two great towers support four huge cables .  The towers are built on immense underwater platforms make of steel and concrete .  The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea .  These alone took sixteen months to build .  Above the surface of the water , the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet .  They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended .  Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire .  It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars , it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity .  However , size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge .  Despite its immensity , it is both simple and elegant , fulfilling its designer 's dream to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible ' .	137.0 8.0 582.0 50.0 50.0 0.0 10.5385 0.6154 44.7692 2.7453 3.8462 3.8462 0.0 0.2358 0.2358 0.0 4.47146241 0.933037118 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.461538 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.153846 7.0 0.538462 3.0 0.230769 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.153846 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.538462 20.0 1.538462 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.230769 7.0 0.538462 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 24.0 1.846154 3.0 0.230769 2.0 0.153846 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 30.0 2.307692 2.0 0.153846 0.0 0.0 21.0 1.615385 25.0 1.923077 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.153846 14.0 1.076923 7.0 0.538462 3.0 0.230769 829.0 259.0 190.0 3.0 2.0 122.0 92.0 13.0 4.363158 1.363158 19.923077 14.615385 0.230769 0.153846 0.642105 0.484211 2.0 
2 What mistake was made ?  The great racing driver , Sir Malcolm Campbell , was the first man to drive at over 300 miles per hour .  He set up a new world record in September 1935 at Bonneville Salt Flats , Utah .  Bluebird , the car he was driving , had been specially built for him .  It was over 30 feet in length and had a 2,500-horsepower engine .  Although Campbell reached a speed of over 304 miles per hour , he had great difficulty in controlling the car because a tyre burst during the first run .  After his attempt , Campbell was disappointed to learn that his average speed had been 299 miles per hour .  However , a few days later , he was told that a mistake had been made .  His average speed had been 301 miles per hour .  Since that time , racing drivers have reached speeds over 600 miles an hour .  Following in his father 's footsteps many years later , Sir Malcolm 's son , Donald , also set up a world record .  Like his father , he was driving a car called Bluebird .	153.0 5.0 560.0 62.0 51.0 3.0 8.0526 0.2632 29.4737 2.467 3.2632 2.6842 0.1579 0.2731 0.2247 0.0132 4.15495188 1.3814004 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.105263 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.368421 4.0 0.210526 1.0 0.052632 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.421053 17.0 0.894737 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.263158 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.052632 18.0 0.947368 2.0 0.105263 5.0 0.263158 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 37.0 1.947368 4.0 0.210526 1.0 0.052632 9.0 0.473684 23.0 1.210526 6.0 0.315789 1.0 0.052632 17.0 0.894737 17.0 0.894737 2.0 0.105263 672.0 212.0 168.0 1.0 0.0 82.0 53.0 19.0 4.0 1.261905 11.157895 8.842105 0.052632 0.0 0.488095 0.315476 2.0 
2 Did the boy go where he wanted to ?  Children who play truant from school are unimaginative .  A quiet day 's fishing , or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again , is usually as far as they get .  They have all been put to shame by a boy who , while playing truant , travelled 1,600 miles .  He hitchhiked to Dover and , towards evening , went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep .  When he woke up next morning , he discovered that the boat had , in the meantime , travelled to Calais .  No one noticed the boy as he crept off .  From there , he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry .  The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city .  The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would , but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border .  There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities .  He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading school .	122.0 5.0 577.0 57.0 53.0 2.0 9.3846 0.3846 44.3846 2.7089 4.3846 4.0769 0.1538 0.2676 0.2488 0.0094 4.326074978 1.141548488 3.0 0.230769 1.0 0.076923 15.0 1.153846 0.0 0.0 13.0 1.0 6.0 0.461538 1.0 0.076923 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.769231 24.0 1.846154 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.153846 11.0 0.846154 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.230769 6.0 0.461538 5.0 0.384615 1.0 0.076923 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 23.0 1.769231 3.0 0.230769 1.0 0.076923 12.0 0.923077 20.0 1.538462 2.0 0.153846 2.0 0.153846 13.0 1.0 14.0 1.076923 0.0 0.0 818.0 251.0 191.0 2.0 1.0 106.0 72.0 13.0 4.282723 1.314136 19.307692 14.692308 0.153846 0.076923 0.554974 0.376963 2.0 
2 Why was their disguise 'too perfect ' ?  An ancient bus stopped by a dry river bed and a party of famous actors and actresses got off .  Dressed in dark glasses and old clothes , they had taken special precautions so that no one should recognize them .  But as they soon discovered , disguises can sometimes be too perfect .  'This is a wonderful place for a picnic , ' said Gloria Gleam .  'It could n't be better , Gloria , ' Brinksley Meers agreed .  'No newspaper men , no film fans !  Why do n't we come more often ? '  Meanwhile , two other actors , Rockwall Slinger and Merlin Greeves , had carried two large food baskets to a shady spot under some trees .  When they had all made themselves comfortable , a stranger appeared .  He looked very angry .  'Now you get out of here , all of you ! '  he shouted .  'I 'm sheriff here .  Do you see that notice ?

2 How did the woman get help ?  When a light passenger plane flew off course some time ago , it crashed in the mountains and its pilot was killed .  The only passengers , a young woman and her two baby daughters , were unhurt .  It was the middle of winter .  Snow lay thick on the ground .  The woman knew that the nearest village was miles away .  When it grew dark , she turned a suitcase into a bed and put the children inside it , covering them with all the clothes she could find .  During the night , it got terribly cold .  The woman kept as near as she could to the children and even tried to get into the case herself , but it was too small .  Early next morning , she heard planes passing overhead and wondered how she could send a signal .  Then she had an idea .  She stamped out the letters 'SOS ' in the snow .  Fortunately , a pilot saw the signal and sent a message by radio to the nearest town .  It was not long before a helicopter arrived on the scene to rescue the survivors of the plane crash .	89.0 0.0 336.0 37.0 28.0 1.0 6.3571 0.0 24.0 2.5455 2.6429 2.0 0.0714 0.2803 0.2121 0.0076 4.165724144 0.928142281 2.0 0.142857 8.0 0.571429 4.0 0.285714 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.357143 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.428571 8.0 0.571429 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.357143 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.142857 12.0 0.857143 1.0 0.071429 1.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 20.0 1.428571 5.0 0.357143 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.214286 11.0 0.785714 3.0 0.214286 1.0 0.071429 6.0 0.428571 7.0 0.5 1.0 0.071429 460.0 136.0 108.0 1.0 0.0 76.0 59.0 14.0 4.259259 1.259259 9.714286 7.714286 0.071429 0.0 0.703704 0.546296 2.0 
2 What was the joke ?  'To end our special news bulletin , ' said the voice of the television announcer , 'we 're going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria .  Macaroni has been grown in this area for over six hundred years .  Two of the leading growers , Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante , tell me that they have been expecting a splendid crop this year and harvesting has begun earlier than usual .  Here you can see two workers who , between them , have just finished cutting three cartloads of golden brown macaroni stalks .  The whole village has been working day and night gathering and threshing this year 's crop before the September rains .  On the right , you can see Mrs. Brabante herself .  She has been helping her husband for thirty years now .  Mrs. Brabante is talking to the manager of the local factory where the crop is processed .  This last scene shows you what will happen at the end of the harvest : the famous Calabrian macaroni-eating competition !  Signor Fratelli , the present champion , has won it every year since 1991 .  And that ends our special bulletin for today , Thursday , April lst .  We 're now going back to the studio .

2 Did the doctors find out how the woman died ?  The mummy of an Egyptian woman who died in 800 B.C .  has just had an operation .  The mummy is that of Shepenmut who was once a singer in the Temple of Thebes .  As there were strange marks on the X-ray plates taken of the mummy , doctors have been trying to find out whether the woman died of a rare disease .  The only way to do this was to operate .  The operation , which lasted for over four hours , proved to be very difficult because of the hard resin which covered the skin .  The doctors removed a section of the mummy and sent it to a laboratory .  They also found something which the X-ray plates did not show : a small wax figure of the god Duamutef .  This god which has the head of a cow was normally placed inside a mummy .  The doctors have not yet decided how the woman died .  They feared that the mummy would fall to pieces when they cut it open , but fortunately this has not happened .  The mummy successfully survived the operation .	115.0 6.0 582.0 72.0 45.0 2.0 10.4545 0.5455 52.9091 2.7847 6.5455 4.0909 0.1818 0.3445 0.2153 0.0096 4.369585367 0.954762974 0.0 0.0 11.0 1.0 6.0 0.545455 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.545455 1.0 0.090909 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 11.0 1.0 21.0 1.909091 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.272727 3.0 0.272727 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.090909 19.0 1.727273 5.0 0.454545 4.0 0.363636 1.0 0.090909 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 34.0 3.090909 6.0 0.545455 1.0 0.090909 7.0 0.636364 32.0 2.909091 5.0 0.454545 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.727273 5.0 0.454545 1.0 0.090909 834.0 272.0 191.0 1.0 1.0 113.0 89.0 11.0 4.366492 1.424084 24.727273 17.363636 0.090909 0.090909 0.591623 0.465969 2.0 
2 For how long did the writer give up smoking ?  After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health ' I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves .  I smoked with concentration and pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette .  For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time , my wife suffered terribly .  I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking : a bad temper and an enormous appetite .  My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars .  They made no effort to hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket .  After seven days of this I went to a party .  Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable .  When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette , it was more than I could bear .  I took one guiltily , lit it and smoked with satisfaction .  My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal once more .  Anyway , as Brian pointed out , it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking .  He himself has done it lots of times !	147.0 9.0 627.0 69.0 61.0 2.0 9.1875 0.5625 39.1875 2.6345 4.3125 3.8125 0.125 0.2899 0.2563 0.0084 4.390490544 0.930734205 1.0 0.0625 2.0 0.125 4.0 0.25 0.0 0.0 7.0 0.4375 7.0 0.4375 3.0 0.1875 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 9.0 0.5625 15.0 0.9375 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.3125 5.0 0.3125 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 18.0 1.125 5.0 0.3125 3.0 0.1875 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 36.0 2.25 5.0 0.3125 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.625 24.0 1.5 1.0 0.0625 4.0 0.25 25.0 1.5625 10.0 0.625 2.0 0.125 770.0 256.0 190.0 3.0 3.0 115.0 87.0 16.0 4.052632 1.347368 16.0 11.875 0.1875 0.1875 0.605263 0.457895 2.0 
2 Why did the plane turn back ?  I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy .  My parents used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe in the holidays .  A flight attendant would take charge of me and I never had an unpleasant experience .  I am used to traveling by air and only on one occasion have I ever felt frightened .  After taking off , we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height , when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport .  While we were waiting to land , a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quietly as soon as it had touched down .  Everybody on board was worried and we were curious to find out what had happened .  Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board .  The police had been told that a bomb had been planted on the plane .  After we had landed , the plane was searched thoroughly .  Fortunately , nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again .	109.0 4.0 571.0 70.0 46.0 2.0 10.9 0.4 57.1 2.7452 7.0 4.6 0.2 0.3365 0.2212 0.0096 4.255265865 1.158963189 1.0 0.1 23.0 2.3 9.0 0.9 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.1 9.0 0.9 1.0 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.5 27.0 2.7 1.0 0.1 1.0 0.1 19.0 1.9 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 13.0 1.3 1.0 0.1 1.0 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.2 22.0 2.2 3.0 0.3 3.0 0.3 5.0 0.5 25.0 2.5 4.0 0.4 1.0 0.1 4.0 0.4 7.0 0.7 1.0 0.1 801.0 271.0 184.0 5.0 2.0 97.0 67.0 10.0 4.353261 1.472826 27.1 18.4 0.5 0.2 0.527174 0.36413 2.0 
2 Why is Joe 's garden the most beautiful one in the town ?  Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town .  Nearly everybody enters for 'The Nicest Garden Competition ' each year , but Joe wins every time .  Bill Frith 's garden is larger than Joe 's .  Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetables , but Joe 's garden is more interesting .  He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool .  I like gardens too , but I do not like hard work .  Every year I enter for the garden competition too , and I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town !	138.0 8.0 573.0 60.0 46.0 6.0 11.5 0.6667 47.75 2.7951 5.0 3.8333 0.5 0.2927 0.2244 0.0293 4.503063172 1.016687771 3.0 0.25 3.0 0.25 15.0 1.25 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.833333 5.0 0.416667 3.0 0.25 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.083333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 15.0 1.25 29.0 2.416667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.333333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.25 8.0 0.666667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 26.0 2.166667 2.0 0.166667 1.0 0.083333 13.0 1.083333 19.0 1.583333 3.0 0.25 2.0 0.166667 10.0 0.833333 12.0 1.0 2.0 0.166667 819.0 260.0 187.0 2.0 1.0 115.0 82.0 12.0 4.379679 1.390374 21.666667 15.583333 0.166667 0.083333 0.614973 0.438503 2.0 
2 How many people visited the Great Exhibition of 1851 ?  Perhaps the most extraordinary building of the nineteeth century was the Crystal Palace , which was built in Hyde Park for the Great Exhibition of 1851 .  The Crystal Palace was different from all other buildings in the world , for it was made of iron and glass .  It was one of the biggest buildings of all time and a lot of people from many countries came to see it .  A great many goods were sent to the exhibition from various parts of the world .  There was also a great deal of machinery on display .  The most wonderful piece of machinery on show was Nasmyth 's steam hammer .  Though in those days , traveling was not as easy as it is today , steam boats carried thousands of visitors across the Channel from Europe .  On arriving in England , they were taken to the Crystal Palace by train .  There were six million visitors in all , and the profits from the exhibition were used to build museums and colleges .  Later , the Crystal Palace was moved to South London .  It remained one of the most famous buildings in the world until it was burnt down in 1936 .	162.0 2.0 573.0 71.0 41.0 4.0 6.75 0.0833 23.875 2.3875 2.9583 1.7083 0.1667 0.2958 0.1708 0.0167 4.443630811 1.075493828 1.0 0.041667 10.0 0.416667 5.0 0.208333 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.125 1.0 0.041667 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.166667 21.0 0.875 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.208333 6.0 0.25 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.083333 22.0 0.916667 1.0 0.041667 3.0 0.125 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 38.0 1.583333 3.0 0.125 0.0 0.0 10.0 0.416667 19.0 0.791667 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.333333 16.0 0.666667 13.0 0.541667 0.0 0.0 766.0 252.0 176.0 12.0 5.0 109.0 78.0 24.0 4.352273 1.431818 10.5 7.333333 0.5 0.208333 0.619318 0.443182 2.0 
2 What was the polite request ?  If you park your car in the wrong place , a traffic policeman will soon find it .  You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket .  However , this does not always happen .  Traffic police are sometimes very polite .  During a holiday in Sweden , I found this note on my car : 'sir , we welcome you to our city .  This is a `` No Parking '' area .  You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs .  This note is only a reminder .

2 Why did the prisoner attack the driver ?  When he had killed the guard , the prisoner of war quickly dragged him into the bushes .  Working rapidly in the darkness , he soon changed into the dead man 's clothes .  Now , dressed in a blue uniform and with a rifle over his shoulder , the prisoner marched boldly up and down in front of the camp .  He could hear shouting in the camp itself .  Lights were blazing and men were running here and there : they had just discovered that a prisoner had escaped .  At that moment , a large black car with four officers inside it , stopped at the camp gates .  The officers got out and the prisoner stood to attention and saluted as they passed .  When they had gone , the driver of the car came towards him .  The man obviously wanted to talk .  He was rather elderly with grey hair and clear blue eyes .  The prisoner felt sorry for him , but there was nothing else he could do .  As the man came near , the prisoner knocked him to the ground with a sharp blow .  Then , jumping into the car , he drove off as quickly as he could .	346.0 19.0 1660.0 194.0 120.0 10.0 9.8857 0.5429 47.4286 2.7621 5.5429 3.4286 0.2857 0.3228 0.1997 0.0166 5.124216276 1.039979168 2.0 0.057143 1.0 0.028571 39.0 1.114286 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.228571 16.0 0.457143 3.0 0.085714 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.028571 0.0 0.0 13.0 0.371429 79.0 2.257143 1.0 0.028571 4.0 0.114286 19.0 0.542857 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 55.0 1.571429 10.0 0.285714 5.0 0.142857 3.0 0.085714 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.028571 82.0 2.342857 14.0 0.4 4.0 0.114286 27.0 0.771429 63.0 1.8 1.0 0.028571 10.0 0.285714 45.0 1.285714 38.0 1.085714 2.0 0.057143 2337.0 745.0 543.0 8.0 7.0 291.0 216.0 35.0 4.303867 1.372007 21.285714 15.514286 0.228571 0.2 0.535912 0.39779 3.0 
2 What was the monster called ?  Fishermen and sailors sometimes claim to have seen monsters in the sea .  Though people have often laughed at stories told by seamen , it is now known that many of these 'monsters ' which have at times been sighted are simply strange fish .  Occasionally , unusual creatures are washed to the shore , but they are rarely caught out at sea .  Some time ago , however , a peculiar fish was caught near Madagascar .  A small fishing boat was carried miles out to sea by the powerful fish as it pulled on the line .  Realizing that this was no ordinary fish , the fisherman made every effort not to damage it in any way .  When it was eventually brought to shore , it was found to be over thirteen feet long .  It had a head like a horse , big blue eyes , shining silver skin , and a bright red tail .  The fish , which has since been sent to a museum where it is being examined by a scientist , is called an oarfish .  Such creatures have rarely been seen alive by man as they live at a depth of six hundred feet .	293.0 12.0 1529.0 174.0 109.0 13.0 10.4643 0.4286 54.6071 2.6317 6.2143 3.8929 0.4643 0.2995 0.1876 0.0224 5.113809545 1.053338284 2.0 0.071429 29.0 1.035714 26.0 0.928571 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.035714 15.0 0.535714 2.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.035714 0.0 0.0 12.0 0.428571 65.0 2.321429 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.142857 21.0 0.75 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.178571 56.0 2.0 5.0 0.178571 2.0 0.071429 2.0 0.071429 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 87.0 3.107143 10.0 0.357143 2.0 0.071429 35.0 1.25 50.0 1.785714 4.0 0.142857 13.0 0.464286 33.0 1.178571 36.0 1.285714 2.0 0.071429 2413.0 762.0 514.0 15.0 12.0 274.0 207.0 28.0 4.694553 1.48249 27.214286 18.357143 0.535714 0.428571 0.533074 0.402724 3.0 
2 Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question ?  The former Prime Minister , Mr. Wentworth Lane , was defeated in the recent elections .  He is now retiring from political life and has gone abroad .  My friend , Patrick , has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr. Lane 's Radical Progressive Party .  After the elections , Patrick went to the former Prime Minister 's house .  When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there , the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat , the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad .  On the following day , Patrick went to the house again .  The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance , when Patrick asked the same question .  Though a little suspicious this time , the policeman gave him the same answer .  The day after , Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question .  This time , the policeman lost his temper .  'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday , ' he shouted , 'Mr .  Lane was defeated in the elections .  He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad ! ''  'I know , ' answered Patrick , 'but I love to hear you say it !

2 Who will be driving the buses next week ?  Busmen have decided to go on strike next week .  The strike is due to begin on Tuesday .  No one knows how long it will last .  The busmen have stated that the strike will continue until general agreement is reached about pay and working conditions .  Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week .  Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides ' to people on their way to work .  This will relieve pressure on the trains to some extent .  Meanwhile , a number of university students have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts .  All the students are expert drivers , but before they drive any of the buses , they will have to pass a special test .  The students are going to take the test in two days ' time .  Even so , people are going to find it difficult to get to work .  But so far , the public has expressed its gratitude to the students in letters to the Press .  Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast !	323.0 16.0 1621.0 194.0 117.0 10.0 11.1379 0.5517 55.8966 2.6972 6.6897 4.0345 0.3448 0.3228 0.1947 0.0166 5.105043399 1.122575376 4.0 0.137931 14.0 0.482759 32.0 1.103448 0.0 0.0 21.0 0.724138 25.0 0.862069 8.0 0.275862 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.068966 7.0 0.241379 0.0 0.0 23.0 0.793103 74.0 2.551724 1.0 0.034483 4.0 0.137931 18.0 0.62069 1.0 0.034483 4.0 0.137931 24.0 0.827586 8.0 0.275862 3.0 0.103448 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 75.0 2.586207 14.0 0.482759 0.0 0.0 34.0 1.172414 53.0 1.827586 5.0 0.172414 13.0 0.448276 45.0 1.551724 32.0 1.103448 1.0 0.034483 2311.0 799.0 532.0 30.0 15.0 274.0 194.0 29.0 4.343985 1.50188 27.551724 18.344828 1.034483 0.517241 0.515038 0.364662 3.0 
2 How long has Mr .  Page been teaching ?  I have just received a letter from my old school , informing me that my former headmaster , Mr. Stuart Page , will be retiring next week .  Pupils of the school , old and new , will be sending him a present to mark the occasion .  All those who have contributed towards the gift will sign their names in a large album which will be sent to the headmaster 's home .  We shall all remember Mr .  Page for his patience and understanding and for the kindly encouragement he gave us when we went so unwillingly to school .  A great many former pupils will be attending a farewell dinner in his honour next Thursday .  It is a curious coincidence that the day before his retirement , Mr .  Page will have been teaching for a total of forty years .  After he has retired , he will devote himself to gardening .  For him , this will be an entirely new hobby .  But this does not matter , for , as he has often remarked , one is never too old to learn .	270.0 14.0 1394.0 151.0 112.0 20.0 11.7391 0.6087 60.6087 2.6056 6.5652 4.8696 0.8696 0.2822 0.2093 0.0374 4.990457837 1.163199063 5.0 0.217391 25.0 1.086957 39.0 1.695652 0.0 0.0 11.0 0.478261 14.0 0.608696 1.0 0.043478 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.26087 0.0 0.0 25.0 1.086957 53.0 2.304348 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.26087 18.0 0.782609 1.0 0.043478 6.0 0.26087 18.0 0.782609 6.0 0.26087 14.0 0.608696 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 56.0 2.434783 14.0 0.608696 5.0 0.217391 23.0 1.0 52.0 2.26087 6.0 0.26087 2.0 0.086957 20.0 0.869565 44.0 1.913043 4.0 0.173913 2141.0 707.0 446.0 18.0 17.0 234.0 163.0 23.0 4.800448 1.585202 30.73913 19.391304 0.782609 0.73913 0.524664 0.365471 3.0 
2 What was the danger ?  As the man tried to swing the speedboat round , the steering wheel came away in his hands .  He waved desperately to his companion , who had been water skiing for the last fifteen minutes .  Both men had hardly had time to realize what was happening when they were thrown violently into the sea .  The speedboat had struck a buoy , but it continued to move very quickly across the water .  Both men had just begun to swim towards the shore , when they noticed with dismay that the speedboat was moving in a circle .  It now came straight towards them at tremendous speed .  In less than a minute , it roared past them only a few feet away .  After it had passed , they swam on as quickly as they could because they knew that the boat would soon return .  They had just had enough time to swim out of danger when the boat again completed a circle .  On this occasion , however , it had slowed down considerably .  The petrol had nearly all been used up .  Before long , the noise dropped completely and the boat began to drift gently across the water .	348.0 22.0 1613.0 173.0 147.0 7.0 12.0 0.7586 55.6207 2.7573 5.9655 5.069 0.2414 0.2957 0.2513 0.012 5.08759218 1.042364913 9.0 0.310345 19.0 0.655172 18.0 0.62069 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.068966 24.0 0.827586 3.0 0.103448 1.0 0.034483 1.0 0.034483 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 36.0 1.241379 64.0 2.206897 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.206897 20.0 0.689655 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.103448 39.0 1.344828 5.0 0.172414 11.0 0.37931 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 79.0 2.724138 13.0 0.448276 5.0 0.172414 24.0 0.827586 46.0 1.586207 2.0 0.068966 13.0 0.448276 40.0 1.37931 41.0 1.413793 4.0 0.137931 2319.0 744.0 521.0 14.0 14.0 277.0 211.0 29.0 4.451056 1.428023 25.655172 17.965517 0.482759 0.482759 0.53167 0.40499 3.0 
2 What was wrong with the man 's story ?  'At the time the murder was committed , I was travelling on the 8 o'clock train to London , ' said the man .  'Do you always catch such an early train ? '  asked the inspector .  'Of course I do , ' answered the man .  'I must be at work at 10 o'clock .  My employer will confirm that I was there on time . '  'Would a later train get you to work on time ? '  asked the inspector .  'I suppose it would , but I never catch a later train . '  'At what time did you arrive at the station ? '  'At ten to eight .  I bought a paper and waited for the train . '  'And you did n't notice anything unusual ? '  'Of course not . '  'I suggest , ' said the inspector , 'that you are not telling the truth .  I suggest that you did not catch the 8 o'clock train , but that you caught the 8.25 which would still get you to work on time .  You see , on the morning of the murder , the 8 o'clock train did not run at all .  It broke down at Ferngreen station and was taken off the line .

2 Why is the rescue taking so long ?  Six men have been trapped in a mine for seventeen hours .  If they are not brought to the surface soon they may lose their lives .  However , rescue operations are proving difficult .  If explosives are used , vibrations will cause the roof of the mine to collapse .  Rescue workers are therefore drilling a hole on the north side of the mine .  They intend to bring the men up in a special capsule .  If there had not been a hard layer of rock beneath the soil , they would have completed the job in a few hours .  As it is , they have been drilling for sixteen hours and they still have a long way to go .  Meanwhile , a microphone , which was lowered into the mine two hours ago , has enabled the men to keep in touch with their closest relatives .  Though they are running out of food and drink , the men are cheerful and confident that they will get out soon .  They have been told that rescue operations are progressing smoothly .  If they knew how difficult it was to drill through the hard rock , they would lose heart .	362.0 22.0 1631.0 193.0 119.0 20.0 11.3125 0.6875 50.9688 2.7644 6.0313 3.7188 0.625 0.3271 0.2017 0.0339 5.111037624 1.062950471 8.0 0.25 1.0 0.03125 38.0 1.1875 0.0 0.0 23.0 0.71875 13.0 0.40625 5.0 0.15625 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.03125 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 14.0 0.4375 86.0 2.6875 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.15625 20.0 0.625 1.0 0.03125 0.0 0.0 24.0 0.75 17.0 0.53125 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 77.0 2.40625 12.0 0.375 4.0 0.125 28.0 0.875 48.0 1.5 1.0 0.03125 14.0 0.4375 49.0 1.53125 40.0 1.25 1.0 0.03125 2354.0 770.0 528.0 21.0 14.0 280.0 209.0 32.0 4.458333 1.458333 24.0625 16.5 0.65625 0.4375 0.530303 0.395833 3.0 
2 Who made the only funny joke that evening and why ?  People will do anything to see a free show -- even if it is a bad one .  When the news got round that a comedy show would be presented at our local cinema by the P. and U. Bird Seed Company , we all rushed to see it .  We had to queue for hours to get in and there must have been several hundred people present just before the show began .  Unfortunately , the show was one of the dullest we have ever seen .  Those who failed to get in need not have felt disappointed , as many of the artistes who should have appeared did not come .  The only funny things we heard that evening came from the advertiser at the beginning of the programme .  He was obviously very nervous and for some minutes stood awkwardly before the microphone .  As soon as he opened his mouth , everyone burst out laughing .  We all know what the poor man should have said , but what he actually said was : 'This is the Poo and Ee Seed Bird Company .  Good ladies , evening and gentlemen !

2 What does 'a cold welcome ' refer to ?  On Wednesday evening , we went to the Town Hall .  It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock .  It would strike twelve in twenty minutes ' time .  Fifteen minutes passed and then , at five to twelve , the clock stopped .  The big minute hand did not move .  We waited and waited , but nothing happened .  Suddenly someone shouted .  'It 's two minutes past twelve !  The clock has stopped ! '  I looked at my watch .  It was true .  The big clock refused to welcome the New Year .  At that moment , everybody began to laugh and sing .	257.0 16.0 1470.0 179.0 100.0 11.0 10.7083 0.6667 61.25 2.6727 7.4583 4.1667 0.4583 0.3255 0.1818 0.02 4.996168462 0.984566882 5.0 0.208333 3.0 0.125 33.0 1.375 0.0 0.0 13.0 0.541667 9.0 0.375 3.0 0.125 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.083333 3.0 0.125 0.0 0.0 14.0 0.583333 66.0 2.75 2.0 0.083333 3.0 0.125 17.0 0.708333 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.041667 24.0 1.0 15.0 0.625 9.0 0.375 1.0 0.041667 1.0 0.041667 0.0 0.0 85.0 3.541667 11.0 0.458333 5.0 0.208333 30.0 1.25 66.0 2.75 1.0 0.041667 18.0 0.75 28.0 1.166667 27.0 1.125 1.0 0.041667 2143.0 693.0 493.0 3.0 3.0 269.0 205.0 24.0 4.346856 1.40568 28.875 20.541667 0.125 0.125 0.545639 0.415822 3.0 
2 Why does n't Aunt Jennifer tell anyone how old she is ?  My aunt Jennifer is an actress .  She must be at least thirty-five years old .  In spite of this , she often appears on the stage as a young girl .  Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon .  This time , she will be a girl of seventeen .

2 What kind of fish are they ?  Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain , but as the oceans have been overfished , fish has become more and more expensive .  So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs .  Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers , who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water , have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work .  Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters .  The fish are not sharks or killer whales , but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes , sometimes as much as twelve feet in length .  Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large : the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea ; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs ; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs .  As a result , the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water .  Who eats who ?	253.0 15.0 1572.0 156.0 137.0 14.0 12.65 0.75 78.6 2.7579 7.8 6.85 0.7 0.2737 0.2404 0.0246 5.014379689 1.15486292 2.0 0.1 1.0 0.05 22.0 1.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 13.0 0.65 8.0 0.4 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.05 1.0 0.05 0.0 0.0 16.0 0.8 73.0 3.65 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.2 24.0 1.2 1.0 0.05 2.0 0.1 56.0 2.8 13.0 0.65 5.0 0.25 1.0 0.05 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 86.0 4.3 19.0 0.95 3.0 0.15 24.0 1.2 57.0 2.85 0.0 0.0 21.0 1.05 36.0 1.8 37.0 1.85 4.0 0.2 2241.0 692.0 528.0 5.0 4.0 258.0 180.0 20.0 4.244318 1.310606 34.6 26.4 0.25 0.2 0.488636 0.340909 3.0 
2 Where was the station 's Commanding Officer ?  A pilot noticed a balloon which seemed to be making for a Royal Air Force Station nearby .  He informed the station at once , but no one there was able to explain the mystery .  The officer in the control tower was very angry when he heard the news , because balloons can be a great danger to aircraft .  He said that someone might be spying on the station and the pilot was ordered to keep track of the strange object .  The pilot managed to circle the balloon for some time .  He could make out three men in a basket under it and one of them was holding a pair of binoculars .  When the balloon was over the station , the pilot saw one of the men taking photographs .  Soon afterwards , the balloon began to descend and it landed near an airfield .  The police were called in , but they could not arrest anyone , for the basket contained two Members of Parliament and the Commanding Officer of the station !  As the Commanding Officer explained later , one half of the station did not know what the other half was doing !	296.0 18.0 1605.0 182.0 122.0 17.0 11.84 0.72 64.2 2.6975 7.28 4.88 0.68 0.3059 0.205 0.0286 5.173569481 0.983386104 20.0 0.8 0.0 0.0 53.0 2.12 0.0 0.0 19.0 0.76 24.0 0.96 2.0 0.08 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.08 1.0 0.04 0.0 0.0 27.0 1.08 65.0 2.6 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.12 11.0 0.44 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.12 4.0 0.16 11.0 0.44 9.0 0.36 2.0 0.08 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 88.0 3.52 13.0 0.52 5.0 0.2 43.0 1.72 45.0 1.8 11.0 0.44 2.0 0.08 26.0 1.04 31.0 1.24 5.0 0.2 2396.0 786.0 522.0 15.0 7.0 304.0 226.0 25.0 4.590038 1.505747 31.44 20.88 0.6 0.28 0.582375 0.43295 3.0 
2 Why did the policeman ask the writer to come to the police station ?  It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home .  I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell , but she was fast asleep , so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden , put it against the wall , and began climbing towards the bedroom window .  I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said , 'I do n't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night . '  I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman .  I immediately regretted answering in the way I did , but I said , 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night . '  'So do I , ' answered the policeman in the same tone .  'Excuse my interrupting you .  I hate to interrupt a man when he 's busy working , but would you mind coming with me to the station ? '  'Well , I 'd prefer to stay here , ' I said .  'You see .  I 've forgotten my key . '  'Your what ? '  he called .  'My key , ' I shouted .  Fortunately , the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards me .	153.0 8.0 755.0 87.0 53.0 4.0 9.0 0.4706 44.4118 2.6491 5.1176 3.1176 0.2353 0.3053 0.186 0.014 4.636177307 1.006459165 0.0 0.0 11.0 0.647059 23.0 1.352941 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.294118 2.0 0.117647 1.0 0.058824 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.176471 40.0 2.352941 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.117647 7.0 0.411765 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.058824 28.0 1.647059 10.0 0.588235 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 35.0 2.058824 11.0 0.647059 0.0 0.0 14.0 0.823529 30.0 1.764706 6.0 0.352941 6.0 0.352941 9.0 0.529412 13.0 0.764706 0.0 0.0 1105.0 353.0 255.0 2.0 1.0 149.0 110.0 17.0 4.333333 1.384314 20.764706 15.0 0.117647 0.058824 0.584314 0.431373 3.0 
2 Where was the Statue of Liberty made ?  One of the most famous monuments in the world , the Statue of Liberty , was presented to the United States of America in the nineteenth century by the people of France .  The great statue , which was designed by the sculptor Auguste Bartholdi , took ten years to complete .  The actual figure was made of copper supported by a metal framework which had been especially constructed by Eiffel .  Before it could be transported to the United States , a site had to be found for it and a pedestal had to be built .  The site chosen was an island at the entrance of New York Harbour .  By 1884 , a statue which was 151 feet tall had been erected in Paris .  The following year , it was taken to pieces and sent to America .  By the end of October 1886 , the statue had been put together again and it was officially presented to the American people by Bartholdi .  Ever since then , the great monument has been a symbol of liberty for the millions of people who have passed through New York Harbour to make their homes in America .	341.0 17.0 1782.0 193.0 154.0 14.0 11.3667 0.5667 59.4 2.7458 6.4333 5.1333 0.4667 0.2974 0.2373 0.0216 5.11757426 1.118603893 11.0 0.366667 0.0 0.0 23.0 0.766667 0.0 0.0 8.0 0.266667 26.0 0.866667 4.0 0.133333 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.066667 2.0 0.066667 0.0 0.0 34.0 1.133333 73.0 2.433333 0.0 0.0 4.0 0.133333 16.0 0.533333 3.0 0.1 1.0 0.033333 31.0 1.033333 13.0 0.433333 9.0 0.3 1.0 0.033333 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 104.0 3.466667 16.0 0.533333 1.0 0.033333 32.0 1.066667 76.0 2.533333 4.0 0.133333 13.0 0.433333 35.0 1.166667 46.0 1.533333 5.0 0.166667 2445.0 811.0 583.0 17.0 10.0 289.0 210.0 30.0 4.193825 1.391081 27.033333 19.433333 0.566667 0.333333 0.495712 0.360206 3.0 
2 What kind of race do the children compete in ?  Experiments have proved that children can be instructed in swimming at a very early age .  At a special swimming pool in Los Angeles , children become expert at holding their breath under water even before they can walk .  Babies of two months old do not appear to be reluctant to enter the water .  It is not long before they are so accustomed to swimming that they can pick up weights from the floor of the pool .  A game that is very popular with these young swimmers is the underwater tricycle race .  Tricycles are lined up on the floor of the pool seven feet under water .  The children compete against each other to reach the other end of the pool .  Many pedal their tricycles , but most of them prefer to push or drag them .  Some children can cover the whole length of the pool without coming up for breath even once .  Whether they will ever become future Olympic champions , only time will tell .  Meanwhile , they should encourage those among us who can not swim five yards before they are gasping for air .	185.0 9.0 843.0 116.0 55.0 4.0 9.7368 0.4737 44.3684 2.6426 6.1053 2.8947 0.2105 0.3636 0.1724 0.0125 4.781964585 1.191734081 6.0 0.315789 27.0 1.421053 18.0 0.947368 0.0 0.0 5.0 0.263158 9.0 0.473684 1.0 0.052632 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.315789 25.0 1.315789 0.0 0.0 6.0 0.315789 2.0 0.105263 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.157895 22.0 1.157895 1.0 0.052632 1.0 0.052632 2.0 0.105263 1.0 0.052632 0.0 0.0 50.0 2.631579 10.0 0.526316 1.0 0.052632 12.0 0.631579 24.0 1.263158 3.0 0.157895 13.0 0.684211 17.0 0.894737 13.0 0.684211 3.0 0.157895 1161.0 360.0 268.0 3.0 3.0 146.0 98.0 19.0 4.33209 1.343284 18.947368 14.105263 0.157895 0.157895 0.544776 0.365672 3.0 
2 Why was the Ambassador particularly lucky ?  When the Ambassador or Escalopia returned home for lunch , his wife got a shock .  He looked pale and his clothes were in a frightful state .  'What has happened ? '  she asked .  'How did your clothes get into such a mess ? '  'A fire extinguisher , my dear , ' answered the Ambassador drily .  'University students set the Embassy on fire this morning . '  'Good heavens ! '  exclaimed his wife .  'And where were you at the time ? '  'I was in my office as usual , ' answered the Ambassador .  'The fire broke out in the basement .  I went down immediately , of course , and that fool , Horst , aimed a fire extinguisher at me .  He thought I was on fire .  I must definitely get that fellow posted . '  The Ambassador 's wife went on asking questions , when she suddenly noticed a big hole in her husband 's hat .  'And how can you explain that ? '  she asked .  'Oh , that , ' said the Ambassador .  'Someone fired a shot through my office window .  Accurate , do n't you think ?  Fortunately , I was n't wearing it at the time .  If I had been , I would not have been able to get home for lunch .

2 What happens to the lanterns at the end of the festival ?  A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan .  This festival is a cheerful occasion , for on this day , the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living .  As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey , food is laid out for them .  Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way .  All night long , people dance and sing .  In the early morning , the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it .  In towns that are near the sea , the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before , are placed into the water when the festival is over .  Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world .  This is a moving spectacle , for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more .	182.0 7.0 779.0 100.0 53.0 4.0 8.6667 0.3333 37.0952 2.6407 4.7619 2.5238 0.1905 0.339 0.1797 0.0136 4.826093338 0.86488826 7.0 0.333333 8.0 0.380952 36.0 1.714286 0.0 0.0 14.0 0.666667 7.0 0.333333 2.0 0.095238 0.0 0.0 2.0 0.095238 2.0 0.095238 0.0 0.0 11.0 0.52381 32.0 1.52381 0.0 0.0 3.0 0.142857 5.0 0.238095 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.047619 6.0 0.285714 3.0 0.142857 1.0 0.047619 3.0 0.142857 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 30.0 1.428571 6.0 0.285714 1.0 0.047619 10.0 0.47619 24.0 1.142857 9.0 0.428571 4.0 0.190476 14.0 0.666667 19.0 0.904762 0.0 0.0 1125.0 351.0 251.0 7.0 4.0 165.0 128.0 21.0 4.482072 1.398406 16.714286 11.952381 0.333333 0.190476 0.657371 0.50996 3.0 
4 Why is there no risk to the customer when a bank prints the customer 's name on his cheques ?  When anyone opens a current account at a bank , he is lending the bank money , repayment of which he may demand at any time , either in cash or by drawing a cheque in favour of another person .  Primarily , the banker-customer relationship is that of debtor and creditor -- who is which depending on whether the customer 's account is in credit or is overdrawn .  But , in addition to that basically simple concept , the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another .  Many of these obligations can give in to problems and complications but a bank customer , unlike , say , a buyer of goods , can not complain that the law is loaded against him .  The bank must obey its customer 's instructions , and not those of anyone else .  When , for example , a customer first opens an account , he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques draw by himself .  He gives the bank specimens of his signature , and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer 's money on a cheques on which its customer 's signature has been forged .  It makes no difference that the forgery may have been a very skilful one : the bank must recognize its customer 's signature .  For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice , adopted by banks , of printing the customer 's name on his cheques .  If this facilitates forgery , it is the bank which will lose , not the customer .  GORDON BARRIE and AUBREY L.

4 What is the most influential factor in any human society ?  In man 's early days .  competition with other creatures must have been critical .  But this phase of our development is now finished .  Indeed , we lack practice and experience nowadays in dealing with primitive conditions .  I am sure that , without modern weapons , I would make a very poor show of disputing the ownership of a cave with a bear , and in this I do not think that I stand alone .  The last creature to compete with man was the mosquito .  But even the mosquito has been subdued by attention to drainage and by chemical sprays .  Competition between our selves , person against person , community against community , still persists , however ; and it is as fierce as it ever was .  But the competition of man against man is not the simple process envisioned in biology .  It is not a simple competition for a fixed amount of food determined by the physical environment , because the environment that determines our evolution is no longer essentially physical .  Our environment is chiefly conditoned by the things we believe .  Morocco and California are bits of the Earth in very similar latitudes , both on the west coasts of continents with similar climates , and probably with rather similar natural resources .  Yet their present development is wholly different , not so much because of different people wish to emphasize .  The most important factor in our environment is the state of our own minds .  It is well known that where the white man has invaded a primitive culture , the most destructive effects have come not from physical weapons but from ideas .  Ideas are dangerous .  The Holy Office knew this full well when it caused heretics to be burned in days gone by .  Indeed , the concept of free speech only exists in our modern society because when you are inside a community , you are conditioned by the conventions of the community to such a degree that it is very difficult to conceive of anything really destructive .  It is only someone looking on from outside that can inject the dangerous thoughts .  I do not doubt that it would be possible to inject ideas into the modern world that would utterly destroy us .  I would like to give you an example , but fortunately I can not do so .  Perhaps it will suffice to mention the unclear bomb .  Of making the effect on a reasonably advanced technological society , one that still does not possess the bomb , of making it aware of the possibility , of supplying sufficient details to enable the thing to be constructed .  Twenty or thirty pages of information handed to any of the major world powers around the year 1925 would have been sufficient to change the course of world history .  It is a strange thought , but I believe a correct one , that twenty or thirty pages of ideas and information would be capable of turning the present-day world upside down , or even destroying it .  I have often tried to conceive of what those pages might contain , but of course outside the particular patterns that our brains are conditioned to , or , to be more accurate , we can think only a very little way outside , and then only if we are very original .

4 Who , according to the author , are 'Fortune 's favoured children ' ?  a gifted American psychologist has said , 'Worry is a spasm of the emotion ; the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go . '  It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition .  The stronger the will , the more futile the task .  One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp .  And if this something else is rightly chosen , if it really attended by the illumination of another field of interest , gradually , and often quite swiftly , the old undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair begins .  The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of the first importance to a public man .  But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command of the will .  The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process .  The seeds must by carefully chosen ; they must fall on good ground ; they must be sedulously tended , if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed .  To be really happy and really safe , one ought to have at least two or three hobbies , and they must all be real .  It is no use starting late in life to say : 'I will take an interest in this or that . '  Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort .  A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work , and yet get hardly any benefit or relief .  It is no use doing what you like ; you have got to like what you do .  Broadly speaking , human beings may be divided into three classes : those who are toiled to death , those who are worried to hard week 's sweat and effort , the chance of playing a game of football or baseball or Saturday afternoon .  It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man , who has beer working or worrying about serious things for six days , to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend .  As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want , who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire -- for them a new pleasure , a new excitement if only an additional satiation .  In vain they rush frantically round from place to place , trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere clatter and motion .  For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path .  It may also be said that rational , industrious , useful human being are divided into two classes : first , one .  Of these the former are the majority .  They have their compensations .  The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward , not only the means of sustenance , but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms .  But Fortune 's of sustenance , but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and modest forms .  But Fortune 's favoured children belong to the second class .  Their life is a natural harmony .  For them the working hours are never long enough .  Each day is a holiday , and ordinary holidays , when they come , are grudged as enforced as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation .  Yet to both classes , the need of an alternative outlook , of a change of atmosphere , of a diversion of effort , is essential .  Indeed , it may well be that those work is their pleasure are those who and most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds .

4 What is one of the features of modern camping where nationality is concerned ?  Economy is one powerful motive for camping , since after the initial outlay upon equipment , or through hiring it , the total expense can be far less than the cost of hotels .  But , contrary to a popular assumption , it is far from being the only one , or even the greatest .  The man who manoeuvres carelessly into his twenty pounds ' worth of space at one of Europe 's myriad permanent sites may find himself bumping a Bentley .  More likely , Ford Escort will be hub to hub with Renault or Mercedes , but rarely with bicycles made for two .  That the equipment of modern camping becomes yearly more sophisticated is an entertaining paradox for the cynic , a brighter promise for the hopeful traveler who has sworn to get away from it all .  It also provides-and some student sociologist might care to base his thesis upon the phenomenon -- an escape of another kind .  The modern traveller is often a man who dislikes the Splendide and the Bellavista , not because he can not afford , or shuns their material comforts .  but because he is afford of them .  Affluent he may be , but he is by no means sure what to tip the doorman or the chambermaid .  Master in his own house , he has little idea of when to say boo to a maitre d'hotel .  From all such fears camping releases him .  Granted , a snobbery of camping itself , based upon equipment and techniques , already exists ; but it is of a kind that , if he meets it , he can readily understand and deal with .  There is no superior 'they ' in the shape of managements and hotel hierarchies to darken his holiday days .  To such motives , yet another must be added .  The contemporary phenomenon of car worship is to be explained not least by the sense of independence and freedom that ownership entails .  To this pleasure camping gives an exquisite refinement .  From one 's own front door to home or foreign hills or sands and back again , everything is to hand .  Not only are the means of arriving at the holiday paradise entirely within one 's own command and keeping , but the means of escape from holiday hel ( if the beach proves too crowded , the local weather too inclement ) are there , outside -- or , as likely , part of -- the tent .  Idealists have objected to the package tour , that the traveller abroad thereby denies himself the opportunity of getting to know the people of the country visited .  Insularity and self-containment , it is argued , go hand in hand .  The opinion does not survive experience of a popular Continental camping place .  Holiday hotels tend to cater for one nationality of visitors especially , sometimes exclusively .  Camping sites , by contrast , are highly cosmopolitan .  Granted , a preponderance of Germans is a characteristic that seems common to most Mediterranean sites ; but as yet there is no overwhelmingly specialized patronage .  Notices forbidding the open-air drying of clothes , or the use of water points for car washing , or those inviting 'our camping friends ' to a dance or a boat trip are printed not only in French or Italian or Spanish , but also in English , German and Dutch .  At meal times the odour of sauerkraut vies with that of garlic .  The Frenchman 's breakfast coffee competes with the Englishman 's bacon and eggs .  Whether the remarkable growth of organized camping means the eventual death of the more independent kind is hard to say .  Municipalities naturally want to secure the campers ' site fees and other custom .  Police are wary of itinerants who can not be traced to a recognized camp boundary or to four walls .  But most probably it will all depend upon campers themselves : how many heath fires they cause ; how much litter they leave ; in short , whether or not they wholly alienate landowners and those who live in the countryside .  Only good scouting is likely to preserve the freedoms so dear to the heart of the eternal Boy Scout .

4 How does the older investor differ in his approach to investment from the younger investor ?  There is no shortage of tipsters around offering 'get-rich-quick ' opportunities .  But if you are a serious private investor , leave the Las Vegas mentality to those with money to fritter .  The serious investor needs a proper 'portfolio ' -- a well-planned selection of investments , with a definite structure and a clear aim .  But exactly how does a newcomer to the stock market go about achieving that ?  Well , if you go to five reputable stock brokers and ask them what you should do with your money , you 're likely to get five different answers , -- even if you give all the relevant information about your age age , family , finances and what you want from your investments .  Moral ?  There is no one 'right ' way to structure a portfolio .  However , there are undoubtedly some wrong ways , and you can be sure that none of our five advisers would have suggested sinking all ( or perhaps any ) of your money into Periwigs* .  So what should you do ?  We 'll assume that you have sorted out the basics -- like mortgages , pensions , insurance and access to sufficient cash reserves .  You should then establish your own individual aims .  These are partly a matter of personal circumstances , partly a matter of psychology .  For instance , if you are older you have less time to recover from any major losses , and you may well wish to boost your pension income .  So preserving your capital and generating extra income are your main priorities .  In this case , you 'd probably construct a portfolio with some shares ( but not high risk ones ) , along with gilts , cash deposits , and perhaps convertibles or the income shares of split capital investment trusts .  If you are younger , and in a solid financial position , you may decide to take an aggressive approach -- but only if you 're blessed with a sanguine disposition and wo n't suffer sleepless nights over share prices .  If portfolio , alongside your more pedestrian in vestments .  Once you have decided on your investment aims , you can then decide where to put your money .  The golden rule here is spread your risk -- if you put all of your money into Periwigs International , you 're setting yourself up as a hostage to fortune .  *'Periwigs ' is the name of a fictitious company .

4 How does the writer like to treat young people ?  People are always talking about 'the problem of youth ' .  If there is one -- which I take leave to doubt -- then it is older people who create it , not the young themselves .  Let us get down to fundamentals and agree that the young are after all human beings -- people just like their elders .  There is only one difference between an old man and a young one : the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him : and maybe that is where the rub is .  When I was a teenager , I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- that I was a new boy in a huge school , and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem .  For one thing , being a problem gives you a certain identity , and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking .  I find young people exciting .  They have an air of freedom , and they not a dreary commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort .  They are not anxious social climbers , and they have no devotion to material things .  All this seems to me to link them with life , and the origins of things .  It 's as if they were , in some sense , cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures .  All that is in my mind when I meet a young person .  He may be conceited , ill-mannered , presumptuous or fatuous , but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect of elders -- as if mere age were a reason for respect .  I accept that we are equals , and I will argue with him , as an equal , if I think he is wrong .

4 How does the writer describe sport at the international level ?  I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations , and that if only the common peoples of the would could meet one another at football or cricket , they would have no inclination to meet on the hattlefield .  Even if one did n't know from concrete examples ( the 1936 Olympic Games , for instance ) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred , one could deduce if from general principles .  Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive .  You play to win , and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win .  On the village green , where you pick up sides and no feeling of local patriotism is involved , it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise : but as soon as a the question of prestige arises , as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if you lose , the most savage combative instincts are aroused .  Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this .  At the international level , sport is frankly mimic warfare .  But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators : and , behind the spectators , of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests , and seriously believe -- at any rate for short periods -- that running , jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue .

4 In what way does echo-location in bats play an utilitarian role ?  Not all sounds made by animals serve as language , and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role .  To get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions .  Everyone knows that if he shouts in the vicinity of a wall or a mountainside , an echo will come back .  The further off this solid obstruction , the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo .  A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom , and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes , the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated .  So was born the echo-sounding apparatus , now in general use in ships .  Every solid object will reflect a sound , varying according to the size and nature of the object .  A shoal of fish will do this .  So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish .  With experience , and with improved apparatus , it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is herring , cod , or other well-known fish , by the pattern of its echo .  It has been found that certain bats emit squeaks and by receiving the echoes , they can locate and steer clear of obstacles -- or locate flying insects on which they feed .  This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar , the principle of which is similar .

4 What makes trading between rich countries difficult ?  Chickens slaughtered in the United States , claim officials in Brussels , are not fit to grace European tables .  No , say the American : our fowl are fine , we simply clean them in a different way .  These days , it is differences in national regulations , far more than tariffs , that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries .  It is not just farmers who are complaining .  An electric razor that meets the European Union 's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States , and an American-made dialysis machine needs the EU 's okay before is hits the market in Europe .  As it happens , a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to electrocute Americans .  So , ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic , why have two lots of tests where one would do ?  Politicians agree , in principle , so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products .  They hope to finish in time for a trade summit between America and the EU on May 28TH .  Although negotiators are optimistic , the details are complex enough that they may be hard-pressed to get a deal at all .  Why ?  One difficulty is to construct the agreements .  The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and them hammer out different pacts covering , say , electronic goods and drug manufacturing .  The EU -- following fine continental traditions -- wants agreement on general principles , which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries .

4 What important thing did King Alfred learn when he penetrated the Danish camp of Guthrum ?  Alfred the Great acted his own spy , visiting Danish camps disguised as a minstrel .  In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere .  They were not fighting men , and their harp was their passport .  Alfred had learned many of their ballads in his youth , and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring .  While Alfred 's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney , the king himself set out to penetrate the camp of Guthrum , the commander of the Danish invaders .  There had settled down for the winter at Chippenham : thither Alfred went .  He noticed at once that discipline was slack : the Danes had the self-confidence of conquerors , and their security precautions were casual .  They lived well , on the proceeds of raids on neighbouring regions .  There they collected women as well as food and drink , and a life of ease had made them soft .  Alfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney .  The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde .  But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle : and that their commissariat had no organization , but depended on irregular raids .  So , faced with the Danish advance , Alfred did not risk open battle but harried the enemy .  He was constantly on the move , drawing the Danes after him .  His patrols halted the raiding parties : hunger assailed the Danish army .  Now Alfred began a long series of skirmishes -- and within a month the Danes had surrendered .  The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of royal espionage !

4 What do oilmen want to achieve as soon as they strike oil ?  The deepest holes of all made for oil , and they go down to as much as 25,0000 feet .  But we not need to send men down to get the oil our , as we must with other mineral deposits .  The holes are only borings , less than a foot in diameter .  My particular experience is largely in oil , and the search for oil has done more to improve deep drilling than any other mining activity .  When is has been decided where we are going to drill , we put up at the surface an oil derrick .  It has to be tall because it is like a giant block and tackle , and we have to lower into the ground and haul out of the ground great lengths of drill pipe which are rotated by an engine at the top and are fitted with a cutting bit at the bottom .  The geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached , so every so often a sample is obtained with a coring bit .  It cuts a clean cylinder of rock , from which can be seen the strata the drill has been cutting through .  Once we get down to the oil , it usually flows to the surface because great pressure , either from or water , is pushing it .  This pressure must be under control , and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe .  We endeavour to avoid the old , romantic idea of a gusher , which wastes oil and gas .  We want it to stay down the hole until we can lead it off in a controlled manner .

4 Why do small errors make it impossible to predict the weather system with a high degree of accuracy ?  Beyond two or three days , the world 's best weather forecasts are speculative , and beyond six or seven they are worthless .  The Butterfly Effect is the reason .  For small pieces of weather -- and to a global forecaster , small can mean thunderstorms and blizzards -- any prediction deteriorates rapidly .  Errors and uncertainties multiply , cascading upward through a chain of turbulent features , from dust devils and squalls up to continent-size eddies that only satellites can see .  The modern weather models work with a grid of points of the order of sixty miles apart , and even so , some starting data has to guessed , since ground stations and satellites can not see everywhere .  But suppose the earth could be covered with sensors spaced one foot apart , rising at one-foot intervals all the way to the top of the atmosphere .  Suppose every sensor gives perfectly accurate readings of temperature , pressure , humidity , and any other quantity a meteorologist would want .  Precisely at noon an infinitely powerful computer takes all the data and calculates what will happen at each point at 12.01 , then 1202 , then 12.03 ...  The computer will still be unable to predict whether Princeton , New Jersey , will have sun or rain on a day one month away .  At noon the spaces between the sensors will hide fluctuations that the computer will not know about , tiny deviations from the average .  By 12.01 , those fluctuations will already have created small errors one foot away .  Soon the errors will have multiplied to the ten-foot scale , and so on up to the size of the globe .

4 Why is secrecy particularly important in the chemical industries ?  Two factors weigh heavily against the effectiveness of scientific research in industry .  One is the general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out , the other the lack of freedom of the individual research worker .  In so far as any inquiry is a secret one , it naturally limits all those engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists either in other countries or in universities , or even , often enough , in other departments of the same firm .  The degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably .  Some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to them not to keep them secret .  Yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete secrecy until the stage at which patents can be taken out .  Even more processes are never patented at all but kept as secret processes .  This applies particularly to chemical industries , where chance discoveries play a much larger part than they do in physical and mechanical industries .  Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole nature of the research can not be mentioned .  Many firms , for instance , have great difficulty in obtaining technical or scientific books from libraries because they are unwilling to have names entered as having taken out such and such a book , for fear the agents of other firms should be able to trace the kind of research they are likely to be undertaking .

4 What is the author 's main argument about the modern city ?  In the organization of industrial life the influence of the factory upon the physiological and mental state of the workers has been completely neglected .  Modern industry is based on the conception of the maximum production at lowest cost , in order that an individual or a group of individuals may earn as much money as possible .  It has expanded without any idea of the true nature of the human beings who run the machines , and without giving any consideration to the effects produced on the individuals and on their descendants by the artificial mode of existence imposed by the factory .  The great cities have been built with no regard for us .  The shape and dimensions of the skyscrapers depend entirely on the necessity of obtaining the maximum income per square foot of ground , and of offering to the tenants offices and apartments that please them .  This caused the construction of gigantic buildings where too large masses of human beings are crowded together .  Civilized men like such a way of living .  While they enjoy the comfort and banal luxury of their dwelling , they do not realize that they are deprived of the necessities of life .  The modern city consists of monstrous edifices and of dark , narrow streets full of petrol fumes and toxic gases , torn by the noise of the taxicabs , lorries and buses , and thronged ceaselessly by great crowds .  Obviously , it has not been planned for the good of its inhabitants .

4 What factor helped to spread the disease of myxomatosis ?  In the early days of the settlement of Australia , enterprising settlers unwisely introduced the European rabbit .  This rabbit had no natural enemies in the Antipodes , so that it multiplied with that promiscuous abandon characteristic of rabbits .  It overran a whole continent .  It caused devastation by burrowing and by devouring the herbage which might have maintained millions of sheep and cattle .  Scientists discovered that this particular variety of rabbit ( and apparently no other animal ) was susceptible to a fatal virus disease , myxomatosis .  By infecting animals and letting them loose in the burrows , local epidemics of this disease could be created .  Later it was found that there was a type of mosquito which acted as the carrier of this disease and passed it on to the rabbits .  So while the rest of the world was trying to get rid of mosquitoes , Australia was encouraging this one .  It effectively spread the disease all over the continent and drastically reduced the rabbit population .  It later became apparent that rabbits were developing a degree of resistance to this disease , so that the rabbit population was unlikely to be completely exterminated .  There were hopes , however , that the problem of the rabbit would become manageable .  Ironically , Europe , which had bequeathed the rabbit as a pest to Australia , acquired this man-made disease as a pestilence .  A French physician decided to get rid of the wild rabbits on his own estate and introduced myxomatosis .  It did not , however , remain within the confines of his estate .  It spread through France , Where wild rabbits are not generally regarded as a pest but as sport and a useful food supply , and it spread to Britain where wild rabbits are regarded as a pest but where domesticated rabbits , equally susceptible to the disease , are the basis of a profitable fur industry .  The question became one of whether Man could control the disease he had invented .
