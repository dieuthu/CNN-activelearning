When my husband was going into the dining room this morning , he dropped some coins on the floor .
There were coins everywhere .
We looked for them , but we could not find them all .
While we were having breakfast , our little boy , Tommy , found two small coins on the floor .
He put them both into his mouth .
We both tried to get the coins , but it was too late .
Tommy had already swallowed them !
Late that morning , when I was doing the housework , My husband phoned me from the office .
'How 's Tommy ? '
he asked .
'I do n't know , ' I answered , 'Tommy 's been to the toilet three times this morning , but I have n't had any change yet ! '
