Do you like stories ?
I want to tell you a true story .
It happened to a friend of mine a year ago .
While my friend , George , was reading in bed , two thieves climbed into his kitchen .
After they had entered the house , they went into the dining room .
It was very dark , so they turned on a torch .
Suddenly , they heard a voice behind them .
`` What 's up ?
What 's up ? ''
someone called .
The thieves dropped the torch and ran away as quickly as they could .
George heard the noise and came downstairs quickly .
He turned on the light , but he could n't see anyone .
The thieves had already gone .
But George 's parrot , Henry , was still there .
`` What 's up , George ? ''
he called .
'Nothing , Henry , ' George said and smiled .
'Go back to sleep . '
