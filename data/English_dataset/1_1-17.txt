That policeman 's waving to you .
He wants you to stop .
POLICEMAN : Where do you think you are ?
On a race track ?
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour .
GARY : I ca n't have been .
POLICEMAN : I was doing eighty when I overtook you .
POLICEMAN : Did n't you see the speed limit ?
GARY : I 'm afraid I did n't , officer .
I must have been dreaming .
ANN : He was n't dreaming , officer .
I was telling him to drive slowly .
GARY : That 's why I did n't see the sign .
POLICEMAN : Let me see your driving licence .
POLICEMAN : I wo n't charge you this time .
But you 'd better not do it again !
GARY : Thank you .
I 'll certainly be more careful .
ANN : I told you to drive slowly , Gary .
GARY : You always tell me to drive slowly , darling .
ANN : Well , next time you 'd better take my advice !
