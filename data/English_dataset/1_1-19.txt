MARTIN : Where are you going to spend your holidays this year , Gary ?
GARY : We may go abroad .
I 'm not sure .
My wife wants go to Egypt .
I 'd like to there , too .
We ca n't make up our minds .
MARTIN : Will you travel by sea or air ?
GARY : We may travel by sea .
MARTIN : It 's cheaper , is n't it ?
GARY : It may be cheaper .
but it takes a long time .
MARTIN : I 'm sure you 'll enjoy yourselves .
GART : Do n't be so sure .
We might not go anywhere .
My wife always worries too much .
Who 's going to look after the dog ?
Who 's going to look after the house ?
Who 's going to look after the garden ?
We have this problem every year .
in the end , we stay at home and look after everything !
