Last week , my four-year-old daughter , Sally , was invited to a children 's party .
I decided to take her by train .
Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before .
She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw .
Suddenly , a middle-age lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally .
'Hello , little girl , ' she said .
Sally did not answer , but looked at her curiously .
The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large , funny hat .
After the train had left the station , the lady opened her handbag and took to her power compact .
She then began to make up her face .
'Why are you doing that ? '
Sally asked .
'To make myself beautiful , ' the lady answered .
She put away her compact and smiled kindly .
'But you are still ugly , ' Sally said .
Sally was amused , but I was very embarrassed !
