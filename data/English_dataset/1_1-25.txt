I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods .
It is a famous beauty spot .
On Sundays , hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods .
Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy .
Litter baskets have been placed under the trees , but people still throw their rubbish everywhere .
Last Wednesday , I went for a walk in the woods .
What I saw made me very sad .
I counted seven old cars and three old refrigerators .
The little baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper , cigarette ends , old tyres , empty bottles and rusty tins .
Among the rubbish , I found a sign which said , 'Anyone who leaves litter in these woods will be prosecuted ! '
