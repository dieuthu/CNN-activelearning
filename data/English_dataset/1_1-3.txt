GARY : How was the exam , Richard ?
RICHARD : Not too bad .
I think I passed in English and Mathematics .
The questions were very easy .
How about you , Gary ?
GARY : The English and Maths papers were n't easy enough for me .
I hope I have n't failed .
RICHARD : I think I failed the French paper .
I could answer sixteen of the question .
They were very easy .
But I could n't answer the rest .
They were too difficult for me .
GARY : French test are awful , are n't they ?
RICHARD : I hate them .
I 'm sure I 've got a low mark .
GARY : Oh , cheer up !
perhaps we did n't to do badly .
The guy next to me Wrote his name at the top of the paper .
RICHARD : Yes ?
GARY : Then he sat there and looked at it for three hours !
He did n't write a word !
