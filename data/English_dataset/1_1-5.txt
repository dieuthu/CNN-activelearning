ASSISTANT : Do you like this dress , madam ?
LADY : I like the colour very much .
It 's lovely dress , but it 's too small for me .
ASSISTANT : What about this one ?
It 's lovely dress .
It 's very smart .
Short skirts are in fashion now .
Would you like to try it ?
LADY : All right .
LADY : I 'm afraid this green dress it too small for me as well .
It 's smaller than the blue one .
LADY : I do n't like the colour either .
It does n't suit me at all .
I think the blue dress is prettier .
LADY : Could you show me another blue dress ?
I want a dress like that one , but it must be my size .
ASSISTANT : I 'm afraid I have n't got a larger dress .
This is the largest dress in the shop .
