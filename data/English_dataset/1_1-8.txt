MR. FRITH : I like television very much .
How much does it cost ?
ASSISTANT : It 's the most expensive model in the shop .
It costs five hundred pounds .
MR. FRITH : That 's too expensive for us .
We ca n't afford all that money .
ASSISTANT : This model 's less expensive than that one .
It 's only three hundred pounds .
But , of course , it 's not as good as the expensive one .
MR. FRITH : I do n't like the model .
The other model 's more expensive , but it 's worth the money .
MR. FRITH : Can we buy it on instalments ?
ASSISTANT : Of course .
You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds , and then fourteen pounds a month for three years .
MR. FRITH : Do you like it , dear ?
MRS. FRITH : I certainly do , but I do n't like the price .
You always want the best , but we ca n't afford it .
Sometimes you think you 're a millionaire !
MR. FRITH : Millionaires do n't buy things on instalments !
