What had happened to the writer 's bag ?
After I had had lunch at a village pub , I looked for my bag .
I had left it on a chair beside the door and now it was n't there !
As I was looking for it , the landlord came in .
'Did you have a good meal ? ''
he asked .
'Yes , thank you , ' I answered , 'but I ca n't pay the bill .
I have n't got my bag . '
The landlord smiled and immediately went out .
In a few minutes he returned with my bag and gave it back to me .
'I 'm very sorry , ' he said .
'My dog had taken in into the garden .
He often does this ! '
