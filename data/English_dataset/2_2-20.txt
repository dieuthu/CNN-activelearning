What happened to the boys in the night ?
Late in the afternoon , the boys put up their tent in the middle of a field .
As soon as this was done , they cooked a meal over an open fire .
They were all hungry and the food smelled good .
After a wonderful meal , they told stories and sang songs by the campfire .
But some time later it began to rain .
The boys felt tired so they put out the fire and crept into their tent .
Their sleeping bags were warm and comfortable , so they all slept soundly .
In the middle of the night , two boys woke up and began shouting .
The tent was full of water !
They all leapt out of their sleeping bags and hurried outside .
It was raining heavily and they found that a stream had formed in the field .
The stream wound its way across the field and then flowed right under their tent !
