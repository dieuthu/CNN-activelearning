What is Jasper White 's problem ?
Jasper White is one of those rare people who believes in ancient myths .
he has just bought a new house in the city , but ever since he moved in , he has had trouble with cars and their owners .
When he returns home at night , he always finds that someone has parked a car outside his gate .
Because of this , he has not been able to get his own car into his garage even once .
Jasper has put up 'No Parking ' signs outside his gate , but these have not had any effect .
Now he has put an ugly stone head over the gate .
It is one of the ugliest faces I have ever seen .
I asked him what it was and he told me that it was Medusa , the Gorgon .
jasper hopes that she will turn cars and their owners to stone .
But none of them has been turned to stone yet !
