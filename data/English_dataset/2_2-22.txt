Does Captain Fawcett think any trip is too dangerous ?
Captain Ben Fawcett has bought an unusual taxi and has begun a new service .
The 'taxi ' is a small Swiss aeroplane called a 'Pilatus Porter ' .
This wonderful plane can carry seven passengers .
The most surprising thing about it , however , is that it can land anywhere : on snow , water , or even on a ploughed field .
Captain Fawcett 's first passenger was a doctor who flew from Birmingham to a lonely village in the Welsh mountains .
Since then , Captain Fawcett has flown passengers to many unusual places .
Once he landed on the roof of a block of flats and on another occasion , he landed in a deserted car park .
Captain Fawcett has just refused a strange request from a businessman .
The man wanted to fly to Rockall , a lonely island in the Atlantic Ocean , but Captain Fawcett did not take him because the trip was too dangerous .
