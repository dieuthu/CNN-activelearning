What was Frank 's first job ?
Yesterday afternoon Frank Hawkins was telling me about his experiences as a young man .
Before he retired , Frank was the head of a very large business company , but as a boy he used to work in a small shop .
It was his job to repair bicycles and at that time he used to work fourteen hours a day .
He saved money for years and in 1958 he bought a small workshop of his own .
In his twenties Frank used to make spare parts for aeroplanes .
At that time he had two helpers .
In a few years the small workshop had become a large factory which employed seven hundred and twenty-eight people .
Frank smiled when he remembered his hard early years and the long road to success .
He was still smiling when the door opened and his wife came in .
She wanted him to repair their grandson 's bicycle !
