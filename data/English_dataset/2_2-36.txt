What kind of shopping does the writer enjoy , do you think ?
'Do you call that a hat ? '
I said to my wife .
'You need n't be so rude about it , ' my wife answered as she looked at herself in the mirror .
I sat down on one of those modern chairs with holes in it and waited .
We had been in the hat shop for half an hour and my wife was still in front of the mirror .
'We must n't buy things we do n't need , ' I remarked suddenly .
I regretted saying it almost at once .
'You need n't have said that , ' my wife answered .
'I need n't remind you of that terrible tie you bought yesterday . '
'I find it beautiful , ' I said .
'A man can never have too many ties . '
'And a woman ca n't have too many hats , ' she answered .
Ten minutes later we walked out of the shop together .
My wife was wearing a hat that looked like a lighthouse !
