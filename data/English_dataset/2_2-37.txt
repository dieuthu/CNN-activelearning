What happened when the snake charmer began to play jazz ?
As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi , we stopped at a square to have a rest .
After a time , we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square , so we went to have a look at him .
As soon as he saw us , he picked up a long pipe which was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets .
When he began to play a tune , we had our first glimpse of the snake .
It rose out of the basket and began to follow the movements of the pipe .
We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs .
The snake , however , continued to 'dance ' slowly .
It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz !
