What is the special importance of a telescope in space ?
The Hubble telescope was launched into space by NASA on April 20,1990 at a cost of over a billion dollars .
Right from the start there was trouble with the Hubble .
The pictures it sent us were very disappointing because its main mirror was faulty !
NASA is now going to put the telescope right , so it will soon be sending up four astronauts to repair it .
The shuttle Endeavour will be taking the astronauts to the Hubble .
A robot-arm from the Endeavour will grab the telescope and hold it while the astronauts make the necessary repairs .
Of course , the Hubble is above the earth 's atmosphere , so it will soon be sending us the clearest pictures of the stars and distant galaxies that we have ever seen .
The Hubble will tell us a great deal about the age and size of the universe .
By the time you read this , the Hubble 's eagle eye will have sent us thousands and thousands of wonderful pictures .
