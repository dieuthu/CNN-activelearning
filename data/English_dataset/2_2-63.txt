What was 'sweet as honey ' and why ?
In 1963 a Lancaster bomber crashed on Wallis Island , a remote place in the South Pacific , a long way west of Samoa .
The plane was n't too badly damaged , but over the years , the crash was forgotten and the wreck remained undisturbed .
Then in 1989 , twenty-six years after the crash , the plane was accidentally rediscovered in an aerial survey of the island .
By this time , a Lancaster bomber in reasonable condition was rare and worth rescuing .
The French authorities had the plane packaged and moved in parts back to France .
Now a group of enthusiasts are going to have the plane restored .
It has four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines , but the group will need to have only three of them rebuilt .
Imagine their surprise and delight when they broke open the packing cases and found that the fourth engine was sweet as honey -- still in perfect condition .
A colony of bees had turned the engine into a hive and it was totally preserved in beeswax !
