Why does Tazieff risk his life like this ?
Haroun Tazieff , the Polish scientist , has spent his lifetime studying active volcanoes and deep caves in all parts of the world .
In 1948 , he went to Lake Kivu in the Congo to observe a new volcano which he later named Kituro .
Tazieff was able to set up his camp very close to the volcano while it was erupting violently .
Though he managed to take a number of brilliant photographs , he could not stay near the volcano for very long .
He noticed that a river of liquid rock was coming towards him .
It threatened to surround him completely , but Tazieff managed to escape just in time .
He waited until the volcano became quiet and he was able to return two days later .
This time , he managed to climb into the mouth of Kituro so that he could take photographs and measure temperatures .
Tazieff has often risked his life in this way .
He has been able to tell us more about active volcanoes than any man alive .
