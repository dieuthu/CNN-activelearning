Why did Elizabeth tell Nigel that she was going to the dentist ?
I crossed the street to avoid meeting him , but he saw me and came running towards me .
It was no use pretending that I had not seen him , so I waved to him .
I never enjoy meeting Nigel Dykes .
He never has anything to do .
No matter how busy you are , he always insists on coming with you .
I had to think of a way of preventing him from following me around all morning .
'Hello , Nigel , ' I said .
'Fancy meeting you here ! '
'Hi , Elizabeth , ' Nigel answered .
'I was just wondering how to spend the morning -- until I saw you .
You 're not busy doing anything , are you ? '
'No , not at all , ' I answered .
'I 'm going to ... ' 'Would you mind my coming with you ? '
he asked , before I had finished speaking .
'Not at all , ' I lied , 'but I 'm going to the dentist . '
'Then I 'll come with you , ' he answered .
'There 's always plenty to read in the waiting room !
