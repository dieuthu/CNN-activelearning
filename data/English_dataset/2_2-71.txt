Did the boy go where he wanted to ?
Children who play truant from school are unimaginative .
A quiet day 's fishing , or eight hours in a cinema seeing the same film over and over again , is usually as far as they get .
They have all been put to shame by a boy who , while playing truant , travelled 1,600 miles .
He hitchhiked to Dover and , towards evening , went into a boat to find somewhere to sleep .
When he woke up next morning , he discovered that the boat had , in the meantime , travelled to Calais .
No one noticed the boy as he crept off .
From there , he hitchhiked to Paris in a lorry .
The driver gave him a few biscuits and a cup of coffee and left him just outside the city .
The next car the boy stopped did not take him into the centre of Paris as he hoped it would , but to Perpignan on the French-Spanish border .
There he was picked up by a policeman and sent back to England by the local authorities .
He has surely set up a record for the thousands of children who dream of evading school .
