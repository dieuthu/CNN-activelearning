What was the joke ?
'To end our special news bulletin , ' said the voice of the television announcer , 'we 're going over to the macaroni fields of Calabria .
Macaroni has been grown in this area for over six hundred years .
Two of the leading growers , Giuseppe Moldova and Riccardo Brabante , tell me that they have been expecting a splendid crop this year and harvesting has begun earlier than usual .
Here you can see two workers who , between them , have just finished cutting three cartloads of golden brown macaroni stalks .
The whole village has been working day and night gathering and threshing this year 's crop before the September rains .
On the right , you can see Mrs. Brabante herself .
She has been helping her husband for thirty years now .
Mrs. Brabante is talking to the manager of the local factory where the crop is processed .
This last scene shows you what will happen at the end of the harvest : the famous Calabrian macaroni-eating competition !
Signor Fratelli , the present champion , has won it every year since 1991 .
And that ends our special bulletin for today , Thursday , April lst .
We 're now going back to the studio . '
