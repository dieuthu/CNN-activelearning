For how long did the writer give up smoking ?
After reading an article entitled 'Cigarette Smoking and Your Health ' I lit a cigarette to calm my nerves .
I smoked with concentration and pleasure as I was sure that this would be my last cigarette .
For a whole week I did not smoke at all and during this time , my wife suffered terribly .
I had all the usual symptoms of someone giving up smoking : a bad temper and an enormous appetite .
My friends kept on offering me cigarettes and cigars .
They made no effort to hide their amusement whenever I produced a packet of sweets from my pocket .
After seven days of this I went to a party .
Everybody around me was smoking and I felt extremely uncomfortable .
When my old friend Brian urged me to accept a cigarette , it was more than I could bear .
I took one guiltily , lit it and smoked with satisfaction .
My wife was delighted that things had returned to normal once more .
Anyway , as Brian pointed out , it is the easiest thing in the world to give up smoking .
He himself has done it lots of times !
