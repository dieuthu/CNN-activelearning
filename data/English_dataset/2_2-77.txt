Why did the plane turn back ?
I used to travel by air a great deal when I was a boy .
My parents used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe in the holidays .
A flight attendant would take charge of me and I never had an unpleasant experience .
I am used to traveling by air and only on one occasion have I ever felt frightened .
After taking off , we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height , when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport .
While we were waiting to land , a flight attendant told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quietly as soon as it had touched down .
Everybody on board was worried and we were curious to find out what had happened .
Later we learnt that there was a very important person on board .
The police had been told that a bomb had been planted on the plane .
After we had landed , the plane was searched thoroughly .
Fortunately , nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again .
