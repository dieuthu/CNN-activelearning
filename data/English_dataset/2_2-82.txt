Why did Patrick keep on asking the same question ?
The former Prime Minister , Mr. Wentworth Lane , was defeated in the recent elections .
He is now retiring from political life and has gone abroad .
My friend , Patrick , has always been a fanatical opponent of Mr. Lane 's Radical Progressive Party .
After the elections , Patrick went to the former Prime Minister 's house .
When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there , the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat , the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad .
On the following day , Patrick went to the house again .
The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance , when Patrick asked the same question .
Though a little suspicious this time , the policeman gave him the same answer .
The day after , Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question .
This time , the policeman lost his temper .
'I told you yesterday and the day before yesterday , ' he shouted , 'Mr .
Lane was defeated in the elections .
He has retired from political life and gone to live abroad ! ''
'I know , ' answered Patrick , 'but I love to hear you say it ! '
