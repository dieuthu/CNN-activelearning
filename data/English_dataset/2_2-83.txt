Who will be driving the buses next week ?
Busmen have decided to go on strike next week .
The strike is due to begin on Tuesday .
No one knows how long it will last .
The busmen have stated that the strike will continue until general agreement is reached about pay and working conditions .
Most people believe that the strike will last for at least a week .
Many owners of private cars are going to offer 'free rides ' to people on their way to work .
This will relieve pressure on the trains to some extent .
Meanwhile , a number of university students have volunteered to drive buses while the strike lasts .
All the students are expert drivers , but before they drive any of the buses , they will have to pass a special test .
The students are going to take the test in two days ' time .
Even so , people are going to find it difficult to get to work .
But so far , the public has expressed its gratitude to the students in letters to the Press .
Only one or two people have objected that the students will drive too fast !
