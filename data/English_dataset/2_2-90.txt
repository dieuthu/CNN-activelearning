What kind of fish are they ?
Fish and chips has always been a favourite dish in Britain , but as the oceans have been overfished , fish has become more and more expensive .
So it comes as a surprise to learn that giant fish are terrifying the divers on North Sea oil rigs .
Oil rigs have to be repaired frequently and divers , who often have to work in darkness a hundred feet under water , have been frightened out of their wits by giant fish bumping into them as they work .
Now they have had special cages made to protect them from these monsters .
The fish are not sharks or killer whales , but favourite eating varieties like cod and skate which grow to unnatural sizes , sometimes as much as twelve feet in length .
Three factors have caused these fish to grow so large : the warm water round the hot oil pipes under the sea ; the plentiful supply of food thrown overboard by the crews on the rigs ; the total absence of fishing boats around the oil rigs .
As a result , the fish just eat and eat and grow and grow in the lovely warm water .
Who eats who ?
