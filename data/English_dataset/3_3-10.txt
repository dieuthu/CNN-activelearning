How might some of the exhibits have been dangerous ?
Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more .
The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is mistaken .
Even people who take no interest in art can not have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places .
Strange forms stand in gardens , and outside buildings and shops .
We have got quite used to them .
Some so-called 'modern ' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years .
In spite of this , some people -- including myself -- were surprise by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture .
The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said : 'Do not touch the exhibits .
Some of them are dangerous ! '
The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture .
Oddly shaped forms that are suspended form the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody .
These objects , however , were different .
Lined up against the wall , there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres .
The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time .
In the centre of the hall , there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights .
These lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad .
Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily .
It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment .
These peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally , but to give them electric shocks as well !
