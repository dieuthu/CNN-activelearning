Why was even five pounds 'too dear ' ?
Small boats loaded with wares sped to the great liner as she was entering the harbour .
Before she had anchored , the men from the boats had climbed on board and the decks were son covered with colourful rugs from Persia , silks from India , copper coffee pots , and beautiful handmade silverware .
It was difficult not to be tempted .
Many of the tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen , but I decide not to buy anything until I had disembarked .
I had no sooner got off the ship than I was assailed by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring .
I had no intention of buying one , but I could not conceal the fact that I was impressed by the size of the diamonds .
Some of them were as big as marbles .
The man went to great lengths to prove that the diamonds were real .
As we were walking past a shop , he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass .
It took me over half an hour to get rid of him .
The next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches .
I examined one of the pens closely .
It certainly looked genuine .
At the base of the gold cap , the words 'made in the U.S.A ' had been nearly inscribed .
The man said that the pen was worth $ 50 , but as a special favour , he would let me have it for $ 30 .
I shook my head and held up five fingers indicating that I was willing to pay $ 5 .
Gesticulating wildly , the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous , but he eventually reduced the price to $ 10 .
Shrugging my shoulders , I began to walk away when , a moment later , he ran after me and thrust the pen into my hands .
Though he kept throwing up his arms in despair , he readily accepted the $ 5 I have him .
I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain -- until I got back to the ship .
No matter how hard I tried , it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and to this day it has never written a single world !
