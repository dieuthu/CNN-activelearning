How did the policeman discover that the whole thing was a joke ?
It has never been explained why university students seem to enjoy practical jokes more than else .
Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke : the hoax .
Inviting the fire brigade to put out a nonexistent fire is a crude form of deception which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in .
Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims .
When a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university , he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill .
As soon as he had hung up , he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away , they were not take him seriously .
He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people .
Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information .
The student did in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on .
Sure enough , a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away .
When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen .
He threatened to remove them by force .
The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help .
Shortly afterwards , four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen .
As the men refused to stop working , the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill .
The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper .
He threatened to call the police .
At this , the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest .
Pretending to speak seriously , one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station .
Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him to a pay phone .
Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax .
