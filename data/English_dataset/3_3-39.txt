Which type of transport does the writer prefer , do you think ?
People travelling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land , sea , or air .
Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours .
Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy .
It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey .
Reading is only a partial solution , for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep .
During the day , sleep comes in snatches .
At night , when you really wish to go to sleep , you rarely manage to do so .
If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper , you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling , or fumbling to find you ticket for inspection .
Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted .
Long car journeys are even less pleasant , for it is quite impossible even to read .
On motorways you can , at least , travel fairly safely at high speeds , but more often than not , the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic .
By comparison , ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts .
You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks , play games , meet interesting people and enjoy good food -- always assuming , of course , that the sea is calm .
If it is not , and you are likely to get seasick , no form of transport could be worse .
Even if you travel in ideal weather , sea journeys take a long time .
Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of travlling by sea .
Aeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated by them .
They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport .
But nothing can match them for speed and comfort .
Travelling at a height of 30,000 feet , far above the clouds , and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience .
You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey , for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly .
For a few hours , you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight .
The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services .
But even when such refinements are not available , there is plenty to keep you occupied .
An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world .
You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys .
You really see the shape of the land .
If the landscape is hidden from view , you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles before you , while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky .
The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping .
However you decide to spend your time , one thing is certain : you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled .
You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey .
