What does the writer describe as an 'amusing old-fashioned source of noise ' ?
Pollution is the price we pay for an overpopulated , over industrialized planet .
When you come to think about it , there are only four ways you can deal with rubbish : dump it , burn it , turn it into something you can use again , attempt to produce less of it .
We keep trying all four methods , but he sheer volume of rubbish we produce worldwide threatens to overwhelm us .
Rubbish , however , is only part of the problem of polluting our planet .
The need to produce ever-increasing quantities of cheap food leads to a different kind of pollution .
Industrialized farming methods produce cheap meat products : beef , pork and chicken .
The use of pesticides and fertilizers produces cheap grain and vegetables .
The price we pay for cheap food may be already too high : Mad Cow Disease ( BSE ) in cattle , salmonella in chicken and eggs , and wisteria in dairy products .
And if you think you 'll abandon meat and become a vegetarian , you have the choice of very expensive organically-grown vegetables or a steady diet of pesticides every time you think you 're eating fresh salads and vegetables , or just having an innocent glass of water !
However , there is an even more insidious kind of pollution that particularly affects urban areas and invades our daily lives , and that is noise .
Burglar alarms going off at any time of the day or night serve only to annoy passers-by and actually assist burglars to burgle .
Car alarms constantly scream at us in the street and are a source of profound irritation .
A recent survey of the effects of noise revealed ( surprisingly ? )
that dogs barking incessantly in the night rated the highest form of noise pollution on a scale ranging from 1 to 7 .
The survey revealed a large number of sources of noise that we really dislike .
Lawn mowers whining on a summer 's day , late-night parties in apartment blocks , noisy neighbors , vehicles of al kinds , especially large container trucks thundering through quiet village , planes and helicopters flying overhead , large radios carried round in public places and played at maximum volume .
New technology has also made its own contribution to noise .
A lot of people object to mobile phones , especially when they are used in public places like restaurants or on public transport .
Loud conversations on mobile phones invade our thoughts or interrupt the pleasure of meeting friends for a quiet chat .
The noise pollution survey revealed a rather spurring and possibly amusing old fashioned source of noise .
It turned out to be snoring !
Men were found to be the worst offenders .
It was revealed that 20 % of men in their mid-thirties snore .
This figure rises to a staggering 60 % of men in their sixties .
Against these figures , it was found that only 5 % of women snore regularly , while the rest are constantly woken or kept awake by their trumpeting partners .
Whatever the source of noise , one thing is certain : silence , it seems , has become a golden memory .
