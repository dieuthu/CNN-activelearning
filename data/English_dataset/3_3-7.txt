Did George get anything for his fifty pence ?
What ?
Children always appreciate small gifts of money .
Mum or dad , of course , provide a regular supply of pocket money , but uncles and ants are always a source of extra income .
With some children , small sums go a long way .
If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets , they rattle for months inside money boxes .
Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box .
For most of them , fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate .
My nephew , George , has a money box but it is always empty .
Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there .
I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it .
Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble .
On his way to the sweet shop , he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain .
George took off his jacket , rolled up his sleeves and pushed is right arm through the drain cover .
He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere , and what is more , he could no get his arm out .
A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter , but George was firmly stuck .
The fire brigade was called and two fire fighter freed George using a special type of grease .
George was not too upset by his experience because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with large box of chocolates .
