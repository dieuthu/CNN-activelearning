What does the computer industry thrive on apart from anarchy ?
Technology trends may push Silicon Valley back to the future .
Carver Mead , a pioneer in integrated circuits and a professor of computer science at the California Institute of Technology , notes there are now work-stations that enable engineers to design , test and produce chips right on their desks , much the way an editor creates a newsletter on a Macintosh .
As the time and cost of making a chip drop to a few days and a few hundred dollars , engineers may soon be free to let their imaginations soar without being penalized by expensive failures .
Mead predicts that inventors will be able to perfect powerful customized chips over a weekend at the office -- spawning a new generation of garage start-ups and giving the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast .
'We 're got more garages with smart people , ' Mead observes .
'We really thrive on anarchy . '
And on Asians .
Already , orientals and Asian Americans constitute the majority of the engineering staffs at many Valley firms .
And Chinese , Korean , Filipino and Indian engineers are graduating in droves from California 's colleges .
As the heads of next-generation start-ups , these Asian innovators can draw on customs and languages to forge righter links with crucial Pacific Rim markets .
For instance , Alex Au , a Stanford Ph .
D. from Hong Kong , has set up a Taiwan factory to challenge Japan 's near lock on the memory-chip market .
India-born N.Damodar Reddy 's tiny California company reopened an AT & T chip plant in Kansas City last spring with financing from the state of Missouri .
Before it becomes a retirement village , Silicon Valley may prove a classroom for building a global business .
