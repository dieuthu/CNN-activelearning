What do adolescents respect in parents ?
Parents are often upset when their children praise the homes of their friends and regard it as a slur on their own cooking , or cleaning , or furniture , and often are foolish enough to let the adolescents see that they are annoyed .
They may even accuse them of disloyalty , or make some spiteful remark about the friends ' parents .
Such loss of dignity and descent into childish behaviour on the part to their parents about the place or people they visit .
Before very long the parents will be complaining that the child is so secretive and never tells them anything , but they seldom realize that they have brought this on themselves .
Disillusionment with the parents , however good and adequate they may be both as parents and as individuals , is to some degree inevitable .
Most children have such a high ideal of their parents , unless the parents themselves have been unsatisfactory , that it can hardly hope to stand up to a realistic evaluation .
Parents would be greatly surprised and deeply touched if they hope to stand up to a realistic evaluation .
Parents would be greatly surprised and deeply touched if they realized how much belief their children usually have in their character and infallibility , and how much this faith means to a child .
If parents were prepared for this adolescent reaction , and realized that it was a sign that the child was growing up and developing valuable powers of observation and independent judgment , they would not be so hurt , and therefore would not drive the child into opposition by resenting and resisting it .
The adolescent , with his passion for sincerity , always respects a parent who admits that he is wrong , or ignorant , or even that he has been unfair or unjust .
What the child can not forgive is the parent 's refusal to admit these charges if the child knows them to be true .
Victorian parents believed that they kept their dignity by retreating behind an unreasoning authoritarian attitude ; in fact they did nothing of the kind , but children were then too cowed to let them know how they really felt .
Today we tend to go to the other extreme , but on the whole this is a healthier attitude both for the child and the parent .
It is always wiser and safer to face up to reality , however painful it may be at the moment .
