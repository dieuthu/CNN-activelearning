What is one of the most unpleasant discoveries we make about ourselves as we get older ?
At the age of twelve years , the human body is at its most vigorous .
It has yet to reach its full size and strength , and its owner his or her full intelligence ; but at this age the likelihood of death is least .
Earlier , we were infants and young children , and consequently more vulnerable ; later , we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance which , though imperceptible at first , will finally become so steep that we can live no longer , however well we look after ourselves , and however well society , and our doctors , look after us .
This decline in vigour with the passing of time is called ageing .
It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make that we must decline in this way , that if we escape wars , accidents and disease we shall eventually 'die of old age ' , and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person , so that there are heavy odds in favour of our dying between the ages of sixty-five and eighty .
Some of us will die sooner , a few will live longer -- on into a ninth or tenth decade .
But the chances are against it , and there is a virtual limit on how long we can hope to remain alive , however lucky and robust we are .
Normal people tend to forget this process unless and until they are reminded of it .
We are so familiar with the fact that man ages , that people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time , of becoming more likely to die the older we get , was something self-evident , like the cooling of a hot kettle or the wearing-out of a pair of shoes .
They have also assumed that all animals , and probably other organisms such as trees , or even the universe itself , must in the nature of things 'wear out ' .
Most animals we commonly observe do in fact age as we do , if given the chance to live long enough ; and mechanical systems like a wound watch , or the sun , do in fact run out of energy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics ( whether the whole universe does so is a moot point at present ) .
But these are not analogous to what happens when man ages .
A run-down watch is still a watch and can be rewound .
An old watch , by contrast , becomes so worn and unreliable that it eventually is not worth mending .
But a watch could never repair itself -- it does not consist of living parts , only of metal , which wears away by friction .
We could , at one time , repair ourselves -- well enough , at least , to overcome all but the most instantly fatal illnesses and accidents .
Between twelve and eighty years we gradually lose this power ; an illness which at twelve would knock us over , at eighty can knock us out , and another 700 for the survivors to be reduced by half again .
