Why is there no risk to the customer when a bank prints the customer 's name on his cheques ?
When anyone opens a current account at a bank , he is lending the bank money , repayment of which he may demand at any time , either in cash or by drawing a cheque in favour of another person .
Primarily , the banker-customer relationship is that of debtor and creditor -- who is which depending on whether the customer 's account is in credit or is overdrawn .
But , in addition to that basically simple concept , the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another .
Many of these obligations can give in to problems and complications but a bank customer , unlike , say , a buyer of goods , can not complain that the law is loaded against him .
The bank must obey its customer 's instructions , and not those of anyone else .
When , for example , a customer first opens an account , he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques draw by himself .
He gives the bank specimens of his signature , and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer 's money on a cheques on which its customer 's signature has been forged .
It makes no difference that the forgery may have been a very skilful one : the bank must recognize its customer 's signature .
For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice , adopted by banks , of printing the customer 's name on his cheques .
If this facilitates forgery , it is the bank which will lose , not the customer .
