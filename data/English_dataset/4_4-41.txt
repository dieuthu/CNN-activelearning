Who , according to the author , are 'Fortune 's favoured children ' ?
a gifted American psychologist has said , 'Worry is a spasm of the emotion ; the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go . '
It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition .
The stronger the will , the more futile the task .
One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp .
And if this something else is rightly chosen , if it really attended by the illumination of another field of interest , gradually , and often quite swiftly , the old undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair begins .
The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of the first importance to a public man .
But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command of the will .
The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process .
The seeds must by carefully chosen ; they must fall on good ground ; they must be sedulously tended , if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed .
To be really happy and really safe , one ought to have at least two or three hobbies , and they must all be real .
It is no use starting late in life to say : 'I will take an interest in this or that . '
Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort .
A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work , and yet get hardly any benefit or relief .
It is no use doing what you like ; you have got to like what you do .
Broadly speaking , human beings may be divided into three classes : those who are toiled to death , those who are worried to hard week 's sweat and effort , the chance of playing a game of football or baseball or Saturday afternoon .
It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man , who has beer working or worrying about serious things for six days , to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend .
As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want , who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire -- for them a new pleasure , a new excitement if only an additional satiation .
In vain they rush frantically round from place to place , trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere clatter and motion .
For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path .
It may also be said that rational , industrious , useful human being are divided into two classes : first , one .
Of these the former are the majority .
They have their compensations .
The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward , not only the means of sustenance , but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms .
But Fortune 's of sustenance , but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and modest forms .
But Fortune 's favoured children belong to the second class .
Their life is a natural harmony .
For them the working hours are never long enough .
Each day is a holiday , and ordinary holidays , when they come , are grudged as enforced as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation .
Yet to both classes , the need of an alternative outlook , of a change of atmosphere , of a diversion of effort , is essential .
Indeed , it may well be that those work is their pleasure are those who and most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds .
