How does the older investor differ in his approach to investment from the younger investor ?
There is no shortage of tipsters around offering 'get-rich-quick ' opportunities .
But if you are a serious private investor , leave the Las Vegas mentality to those with money to fritter .
The serious investor needs a proper 'portfolio ' -- a well-planned selection of investments , with a definite structure and a clear aim .
But exactly how does a newcomer to the stock market go about achieving that ?
Well , if you go to five reputable stock brokers and ask them what you should do with your money , you 're likely to get five different answers , -- even if you give all the relevant information about your age age , family , finances and what you want from your investments .
Moral ?
There is no one 'right ' way to structure a portfolio .
However , there are undoubtedly some wrong ways , and you can be sure that none of our five advisers would have suggested sinking all ( or perhaps any ) of your money into Periwigs* .
So what should you do ?
We 'll assume that you have sorted out the basics -- like mortgages , pensions , insurance and access to sufficient cash reserves .
You should then establish your own individual aims .
These are partly a matter of personal circumstances , partly a matter of psychology .
For instance , if you are older you have less time to recover from any major losses , and you may well wish to boost your pension income .
So preserving your capital and generating extra income are your main priorities .
In this case , you 'd probably construct a portfolio with some shares ( but not high risk ones ) , along with gilts , cash deposits , and perhaps convertibles or the income shares of split capital investment trusts .
If you are younger , and in a solid financial position , you may decide to take an aggressive approach -- but only if you 're blessed with a sanguine disposition and wo n't suffer sleepless nights over share prices .
If portfolio , alongside your more pedestrian in vestments .
Once you have decided on your investment aims , you can then decide where to put your money .
The golden rule here is spread your risk -- if you put all of your money into Periwigs International , you 're setting yourself up as a hostage to fortune .
*'Periwigs ' is the name of a fictitious company .
