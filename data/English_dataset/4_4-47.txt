What makes trading between rich countries difficult ?
Chickens slaughtered in the United States , claim officials in Brussels , are not fit to grace European tables .
No , say the American : our fowl are fine , we simply clean them in a different way .
These days , it is differences in national regulations , far more than tariffs , that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries .
It is not just farmers who are complaining .
An electric razor that meets the European Union 's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States , and an American-made dialysis machine needs the EU 's okay before is hits the market in Europe .
As it happens , a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to electrocute Americans .
So , ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic , why have two lots of tests where one would do ?
Politicians agree , in principle , so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products .
They hope to finish in time for a trade summit between America and the EU on May 28TH .
Although negotiators are optimistic , the details are complex enough that they may be hard-pressed to get a deal at all .
Why ?
One difficulty is to construct the agreements .
The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and them hammer out different pacts covering , say , electronic goods and drug manufacturing .
The EU -- following fine continental traditions -- wants agreement on general principles , which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries .
